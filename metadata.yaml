description: "Penrod is a collection of comic sketches by Booth Tarkington that was\
  \ first published in 1914. The book follows the misadventures of Penrod Schofield,\
  \ an eleven-year-old boy growing up in the pre-World War I Midwestern United States,\
  \ in a similar vein to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. In Penrod, Tarkington established\
  \ characters who appeared in two further books, Penrod and Sam (1916) and Penrod\
  \ Jashber (1929). The three books were published together in one volume, Penrod:\
  \ His Complete Story, in 1931.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
