    <h2>
      CHAPTER I A BOY AND HIS DOG
    </h2>
    <p>
      Penrod sat morosely upon the back fence and gazed with envy at Duke, his
      wistful dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitter soul dominated the various curved and angular surfaces known by a
      careless world as the face of Penrod Schofield. Except in solitude, that
      face was almost always cryptic and emotionless; for Penrod had come into
      his twelfth year wearing an expression carefully trained to be
      inscrutable. Since the world was sure to misunderstand everything, mere
      defensive instinct prompted him to give it as little as possible to lay
      hold upon. Nothing is more impenetrable than the face of a boy who has
      learned this, and Penrod's was habitually as fathomless as the depth of
      his hatred this morning for the literary activities of Mrs. Lora Rewbush&mdash;an
      almost universally respected fellow citizen, a lady of charitable and
      poetic inclinations, and one of his own mother's most intimate friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lora Rewbush had written something which she called &ldquo;The Children's
      Pageant of the Table Round,&rdquo; and it was to be performed in public that
      very afternoon at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall for the benefit of the
      Coloured Infants' Betterment Society. And if any flavour of sweetness
      remained in the nature of Penrod Schofield after the dismal trials of the
      school-week just past, that problematic, infinitesimal remnant was made
      pungent acid by the imminence of his destiny to form a prominent feature
      of the spectacle, and to declaim the loathsome sentiments of a character
      named upon the programme the Child Sir Lancelot.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each rehearsal he had plotted escape, and only ten days earlier
      there had been a glimmer of light: Mrs. Lora Rewbush caught a very bad
      cold, and it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia; but she recovered
      so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the Children's Pageant was
      postponed. Darkness closed in. Penrod had rather vaguely debated plans for
      a self-mutilation such as would make his appearance as the Child Sir
      Lancelot inexpedient on public grounds; it was a heroic and attractive
      thought, but the results of some extremely sketchy preliminary experiments
      caused him to abandon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no escape; and at last his hour was hard upon him. Therefore he
      brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog's name was undescriptive of his person, which was obviously the
      result of a singular series of mesalliances. He wore a grizzled moustache
      and indefinite whiskers; he was small and shabby, and looked like an old
      postman. Penrod envied Duke because he was sure Duke would never be
      compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot. He thought a dog free and unshackled
      to go or come as the wind listeth. Penrod forgot the life he led Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long soliloquy upon the fence, a plaintive monologue without
      words: the boy's thoughts were adjectives, but they were expressed by a
      running film of pictures in his mind's eye, morbidly prophetic of the
      hideosities before him. Finally he spoke aloud, with such spleen that Duke
      rose from his haunches and lifted one ear in keen anxiety.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,
     Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.
     What though I'm <i>but </i>a littul child,
     Gentul-hearted, meek, and&mdash;&mdash;'  <i>oof</i>!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All of this except &ldquo;oof&rdquo; was a quotation from the Child Sir Lancelot, as
      conceived by Mrs. Lora Rewbush. Choking upon it, Penrod slid down from the
      fence, and with slow and thoughtful steps entered a one-storied wing of
      the stable, consisting of a single apartment, floored with cement and used
      as a storeroom for broken bric-a-brac, old paint-buckets, decayed
      garden-hose, worn-out carpets, dead furniture, and other condemned odds
      and ends not yet considered hopeless enough to be given away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner stood a large box, a part of the building itself: it was
      eight feet high and open at the top, and it had been constructed as a
      sawdust magazine from which was drawn material for the horse's bed in a
      stall on the other side of the partition. The big box, so high and
      towerlike, so commodious, so suggestive, had ceased to fulfil its
      legitimate function; though, providentially, it had been at least half
      full of sawdust when the horse died. Two years had gone by since that
      passing; an interregnum in transportation during which Penrod's father was
      &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; (he explained sometimes) of an automobile. Meanwhile, the
      gifted and generous sawdust-box had served brilliantly in war and peace:
      it was Penrod's stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the box; the
      donjon-keep had known mercantile impulses:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The O. K. RaBiT Co.
     PENROD ScHoFiELD AND CO.
     iNQuiRE FOR PRicEs
</pre>
    <p>
      This was a venture of the preceding vacation, and had netted, at one time,
      an accrued and owed profit of $1.38. Prospects had been brightest on the
      very eve of cataclysm. The storeroom was locked and guarded, but
      twenty-seven rabbits and Belgian hares, old and young, had perished here
      on a single night&mdash;through no human agency, but in a foray of cats,
      the besiegers treacherously tunnelling up through the sawdust from the
      small aperture which opened into the stall beyond the partition. Commerce
      has its martyrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod climbed upon a barrel, stood on tiptoe, grasped the rim of the box;
      then, using a knot-hole as a stirrup, threw one leg over the top, drew
      himself up, and dropped within. Standing upon the packed sawdust, he was
      just tall enough to see over the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke had not followed him into the storeroom, but remained near the open
      doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude. Penrod felt in a dark
      corner of the box and laid hands upon a simple apparatus consisting of an
      old bushel-basket with a few yards of clothes-line tied to each of its
      handles. He passed the ends of the lines over a big spool, which revolved
      upon an axle of wire suspended from a beam overhead, and, with the aid of
      this improvised pulley, lowered the empty basket until it came to rest in
      an upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at the foot of the
      sawdust-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleva-ter!&rdquo; shouted Penrod. &ldquo;Ting-ting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duke, old and intelligently apprehensive, approached slowly, in a
      semicircular manner, deprecatingly, but with courtesy. He pawed the basket
      delicately; then, as if that were all his master had expected of him,
      uttered one bright bark, sat down, and looked up triumphantly. His
      hypocrisy was shallow: many a horrible quarter of an hour had taught him
      his duty in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;El-e-<i>vay</i>-ter!&rdquo; shouted Penrod sternly. &ldquo;You want me to come down
      there to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duke looked suddenly haggard. He pawed the basket feebly again and, upon
      another outburst from on high, prostrated himself flat. Again threatened,
      he gave a superb impersonation of a worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get in that el-e-<i>vay</i>-ter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reckless with despair, Duke jumped into the basket, landing in a
      dishevelled posture, which he did not alter until he had been drawn up and
      poured out upon the floor of sawdust with the box. There, shuddering, he
      lay in doughnut shape and presently slumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark in the box, a condition that might have been remedied by
      sliding back a small wooden panel on runners, which would have let in
      ample light from the alley; but Penrod Schofield had more interesting
      means of illumination. He knelt, and from a former soap-box, in a corner,
      took a lantern, without a chimney, and a large oil-can, the leak in the
      latter being so nearly imperceptible that its banishment from household
      use had seemed to Penrod as inexplicable as it was providential.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook the lantern near his ear: nothing splashed; there was no sound
      but a dry clinking. But there was plenty of kerosene in the can; and he
      filled the lantern, striking a match to illumine the operation. Then he
      lit the lantern and hung it upon a nail against the wall. The sawdust
      floor was slightly impregnated with oil, and the open flame quivered in
      suggestive proximity to the side of the box; however, some rather deep
      charrings of the plank against which the lantern hung offered evidence
      that the arrangement was by no means a new one, and indicated at least a
      possibility of no fatality occurring this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Penrod turned up the surface of the sawdust in another corner of the
      floor, and drew forth a cigar-box in which were half a dozen cigarettes,
      made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping paper, a lead-pencil, an eraser,
      and a small note-book, the cover of which was labelled in his own
      handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;English Grammar. Penrod Schofield. Room 6, Ward School Nomber Seventh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first page of this book was purely academic; but the study of English
      undefiled terminated with a slight jar at the top of the second: &ldquo;Nor must
      an adverb be used to modif&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately followed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;HARoLD RAMoREZ THE RoADAGENT
     OR WiLD LiFE AMoNG THE
     ROCKY MTS.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the subsequent entries in the book appeared to have little concern
      with Room 6, Ward School Nomber Seventh.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II ROMANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The author of &ldquo;Harold Ramorez,&rdquo; etc., lit one of the hayseed cigarettes,
      seated himself comfortably, with his back against the wall and his right
      shoulder just under the lantern, elevated his knees to support the
      note-book, turned to a blank page, and wrote, slowly and earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CHAPITER THE SIXTH&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a knife from his pocket, and, broodingly, his eyes upon the inward
      embryos of vision, sharpened his pencil. After that, he extended a foot
      and meditatively rubbed Duke's back with the side of his shoe. Creation,
      with Penrod, did not leap, full-armed, from the brain; but finally he
      began to produce. He wrote very slowly at first, and then with increasing
      rapidity; faster and faster, gathering momentum and growing more and more
      fevered as he sped, till at last the true fire came, without which no lamp
      of real literature may be made to burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wilson reched for his gun but our hero had him covred and soon said
      Well I guess you don't come any of that on me my freind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well what makes you so sure about it sneered the other bitting his lip so
      savageley that the blood ran. You are nothing but a common Roadagent any
      way and I do not propose to be bafled by such, Ramorez laughed at this and
      kep Mr. Wilson covred by his ottomatick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the two men were struggling together in the death-roes but soon Mr
      Wilson got him bound and gaged his mouth and went away for awhile leavin
      our hero, it was dark and he writhd at his bonds writhing on the floor
      wile the rats came out of their holes and bit him and vernim got all over
      him from the floor of that helish spot but soon he managed to push the gag
      out of his mouth with the end of his toungeu and got all his bonds off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Mr Wilson came back to tant him with his helpless condition flowed by
      his gang of detectives and they said Oh look at Ramorez sneering at his
      plight and tanted him with his helpless condition because Ramorez had put
      the bonds back sos he would look the same but could throw them off him
      when he wanted to Just look at him now sneered they. To hear him talk you
      would thought he was hot stuff and they said Look at him now, him that was
      going to do so much, Oh I would not like to be in his fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Harold got mad at this and jumped up with blasing eyes throwin off
      his bonds like they were air Ha Ha sneered he I guess you better not talk
      so much next time. Soon there flowed another awful struggle and siezin his
      ottomatick back from Mr Wilson he shot two of the detectives through the
      heart Bing Bing went the ottomatick and two more went to meet their Maker
      only two detectives left now and so he stabbed one and the scondrel went
      to meet his Maker for now our hero was fighting for his very life. It was
      dark in there now for night had falen and a terrible view met the eye
      Blood was just all over everything and the rats were eatin the dead men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon our hero manged to get his back to the wall for he was fighting for
      his very life now and shot Mr Wilson through the abodmen Oh said Mr Wilson
      you&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; (The dashes are Penrod's.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wilson stagerd back vile oaths soilin his lips for he was in pain Why
      you&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;you sneered he I will get you yet&mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash;you Harold Ramorez
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainin scondrel had an ax which he came near our heros head with but
      missed him and ramand stuck in the wall Our heros amunition was exhaused
      what was he to do, the remanin scondrel would soon get his ax lose so our
      hero sprung forward and bit him till his teeth met in the flech for now
      our hero was fighting for his very life. At this the remanin scondrel also
      cursed and swore vile oaths. Oh sneered he&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash;you Harold Ramorez what did you bite me for Yes sneered Mr
      Wilson also and he has shot me in the abdomen too the&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they were both cursin and reviln him together Why you&mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;sneered they
      what did you want to injure us for&mdash;&mdash;you Harold Ramorez you
      have not got any sence and you think you are so much but you are no better
      than anybody else and you are a&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
      &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon our hero could stand this no longer. If you could learn to act like

      Harold Ramorez again so with a tantig laugh he cooly lit a cigarrete and
      takin the keys of the cell from Mr Wilson poket went on out.

      Soon Mr Wilson and the wonded detective manged to bind up their wonds and
      got up off the floor&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;it I will have that

    <p>
      A mule train of heavily laden burros laden with gold from the mines was to
      be seen wondering among the highest clifts and gorgs of the Rocky Mts and
      a tall man with a long silken mustash and a cartigde belt could be heard
      cursin vile oaths because he well knew this was the lair of Harold Ramorez
      Why&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;you you&mdash;&mdash;

      &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;mules you
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcly had the vile words left his lips when&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PENROD!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his mother's voice, calling from the back porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, the noon whistles began to blow, far and near; and the
      romancer in the sawdust-box, summoned prosaically from steep mountain
      passes above the clouds, paused with stubby pencil halfway from lip to
      knee. His eyes were shining: there was a rapt sweetness in his gaze. As he
      wrote, his burden had grown lighter; thoughts of Mrs. Lora Rewbush had
      almost left him; and in particular as he recounted (even by the chaste
      dash) the annoyed expressions of Mr. Wilson, the wounded detective, and
      the silken moustached mule-driver, he had felt mysteriously relieved
      concerning the Child Sir Lancelot. Altogether he looked a better and a
      brighter boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pen-<i>rod</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rapt look faded slowly. He sighed, but moved not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod! We're having lunch early just on your account, so you'll have
      plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in Penrod's aerie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pen</i>-rod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofields voice sounded nearer, indicating a threatened approach.
      Penrod bestirred himself: he blew out the lantern, and shouted
      plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain't I coming fast's I can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do hurry,&rdquo; returned the voice, withdrawing; and the kitchen door could be
      heard to close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languidly, Penrod proceeded to set his house in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigar-box, he carefully buried
      the box in the sawdust, put the lantern and oil-can back in the soap-box,
      adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke, and, in no uncertain
      tone, invited the devoted animal to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke stretched himself amiably, affecting not to hear; and when this
      pretence became so obvious that even a dog could keep it up no longer, sat
      down in a corner, facing it, his back to his master, and his head
      perpendicular, nose upward, supported by the convergence of the two walls.
      This, from a dog, is the last word, the comble of the immutable. Penrod
      commanded, stormed, tried gentleness; persuaded with honeyed words and
      pictured rewards. Duke's eyes looked backward; otherwise he moved not.
      Time elapsed. Penrod stooped to flattery, finally to insincere caresses;
      then, losing patience spouted sudden threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke remained immovable, frozen fast to his great gesture of implacable
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A footstep sounded on the threshold of the store-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod, come down from that box this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you up in that sawdust-box again?&rdquo; As Mrs. Schofield had just heard
      her son's voice issue from the box, and also, as she knew he was there
      anyhow, her question must have been put for oratorical purposes only.
      &ldquo;Because if you are,&rdquo; she continued promptly, &ldquo;I'm going to ask your papa
      not to let you play there any&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's forehead, his eyes, the tops of his ears, and most of his hair,
      became visible to her at the top of the box. &ldquo;I ain't 'playing!'&rdquo; he said
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what <i>are </i>you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just coming down,&rdquo; he replied, in a grieved but patient tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you <i>come</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got Duke here. I got to get him <i>down</i>, haven't I? You don't
      suppose I want to leave a poor dog in here to starve, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hand him down over the side to me. Let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get him down all right,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;I got him up here, and I
      guess I can get him down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, <i>do</i> it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you'll let me alone. If you'll go on back to the house I
      promise to be there inside of two minutes. Honest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put extreme urgency into this, and his mother turned toward the house.
      &ldquo;If you're not there in two minutes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After her departure, Penrod expended some finalities of eloquence upon
      Duke, then disgustedly gathered him up in his arms, dumped him into the
      basket and, shouting sternly, &ldquo;All in for the ground floor&mdash;step back
      there, madam&mdash;all ready, Jim!&rdquo; lowered dog and basket to the floor of
      the storeroom. Duke sprang out in tumultuous relief, and bestowed frantic
      affection upon his master as the latter slid down from the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod dusted himself sketchily, experiencing a sense of satisfaction,
      dulled by the overhanging afternoon, perhaps, but perceptible: he had the
      feeling of one who has been true to a cause. The operation of the elevator
      was unsinful and, save for the shock to Duke's nervous system, it was
      harmless; but Penrod could not possibly have brought himself to exhibit it
      in the presence of his mother or any other grown person in the world. The
      reasons for secrecy were undefined; at least, Penrod did not define them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III THE COSTUME
    </h2>
    <p>
      After lunch his mother and his sister Margaret, a pretty girl of nineteen,
      dressed him for the sacrifice. They stood him near his mother's bedroom
      window and did what they would to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute, exceeding the
      pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles; but a student of eyes might
      have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister
      uprising. At a rehearsal (in citizens' clothes) attended by mothers and
      grown-up sisters, Mrs. Lora Rewbush had announced that she wished the
      costuming to be &ldquo;as medieval and artistic as possible.&rdquo; Otherwise, and as
      to details, she said, she would leave the costumes entirely to the good
      taste of the children's parents. Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no
      archeologists, but they knew that their taste was as good as that of other
      mothers and sisters concerned; so with perfect confidence they had planned
      and executed a costume for Penrod; and the only misgiving they felt was
      connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripped to his underwear, he had been made to wash himself vehemently;
      then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings, once
      blue but now mostly whitish. Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere
      ampleness; but they were long, and it required only a rather loose
      imagination to assume that they were tights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a garment so
      peculiar that its description becomes difficult. In 1886, Mrs. Schofield,
      then unmarried, had worn at her &ldquo;coming-out party&rdquo; a dress of vivid salmon
      silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord with various
      epochs of fashion until a final, unskilful campaign at a dye-house had
      left it in a condition certain to attract much attention to the wearer.
      Mrs. Schofield had considered giving it to Della, the cook; but had
      decided not to do so, because you never could tell how Della was going to
      take things, and cooks were scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been the word &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; (in Mrs. Lora Rewbush's rich phrase)
      which had inspired the idea for a last conspicuous usefulness; at all
      events, the bodice of that once salmon dress, somewhat modified and
      moderated, now took a position, for its farewell appearance in society,
      upon the back, breast, and arms of the Child Sir Lancelot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The area thus costumed ceased at the waist, leaving a Jaeger-like and
      unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings. The inventive genius
      of woman triumphantly bridged it, but in a manner which imposes upon
      history almost insuperable delicacies of narration. Penrod's father was an
      old-fashioned man: the twentieth century had failed to shake his faith in
      red flannel for cold weather; and it was while Mrs. Schofield was putting
      away her husband's winter underwear that she perceived how hopelessly one
      of the elder specimens had dwindled; and simultaneously she received the
      inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the Child Sir Lancelot,
      and added an earnest bit of colour, as well as a genuine touch of the
      Middle Ages, to his costume. Reversed, fore to aft, with the greater part
      of the legs cut off, and strips of silver braid covering the seams, this
      garment, she felt, was not traceable to its original source.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it had been placed upon Penrod, the stockings were attached to it by
      a system of safety-pins, not very perceptible at a distance. Next, after
      being severely warned against stooping, Penrod got his feet into the
      slippers he wore to dancing-school&mdash;&ldquo;patent-leather pumps&rdquo; now
      decorated with large pink rosettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can't stoop,&rdquo; he began, smolderingly, &ldquo;I'd like to know how'm I
      goin' to kneel in the pag&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must <i>manage</i>!&rdquo; This, uttered through pins, was evidently
      thought to be sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fastened some ruching about his slender neck, pinned ribbons at
      random all over him, and then Margaret thickly powdered his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, that's all right,&rdquo; she said, replying to a question put by her
      mother. &ldquo;They always powdered their hair in Colonial times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem right to me&mdash;exactly,&rdquo; objected Mrs. Schofield,
      gently. &ldquo;Sir Lancelot must have been ever so long before Colonial times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't matter,&rdquo; Margaret reassured her. &ldquo;Nobody'll know the
      difference&mdash;Mrs. Lora Rewbush least of all. I don't think she knows a
      thing about it, though, of course, she does write splendidly and the words
      of the pageant are just beautiful. Stand still, Penrod!&rdquo; (The author of
      &ldquo;Harold Ramorez&rdquo; had moved convulsively.) &ldquo;Besides, powdered hair's always
      becoming. Look at him. You'd hardly know it was Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable truth
      might have been thought tactless, but Penrod, not analytical, found his
      spirits somewhat elevated. No mirror was in his range of vision and,
      though he had submitted to cursory measurements of his person a week
      earlier, he had no previous acquaintance with the costume. He began to
      form a not unpleasing mental picture of his appearance, something
      somewhere between the portraits of George Washington and a vivid memory of
      Miss Julia Marlowe at a matinee of &ldquo;Twelfth Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed from a
      neighbor, who was a Knight of Pythias. Finally there was a mantle, an old
      golf cape of Margaret's. Fluffy polka-dots of white cotton had been sewed
      to it generously; also it was ornamented with a large cross of red
      flannel, suggested by the picture of a Crusader in a newspaper
      advertisement. The mantle was fastened to Penrod's shoulder (that is, to
      the shoulder of Mrs. Schofield's ex-bodice) by means of large safety-pins,
      and arranged to hang down behind him, touching his heels, but obscuring
      nowise the glory of his facade. Then, at last, he was allowed to step
      before a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a full-length glass, and the worst immediately happened. It might
      have been a little less violent, perhaps, if Penrod's expectations had not
      been so richly and poetically idealized; but as things were, the revolt
      was volcanic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor Hugo's account of the fight with the devil-fish, in &ldquo;Toilers of the
      Sea,&rdquo; encourages a belief that, had Hugo lived and increased in power, he
      might have been equal to a proper recital of the half hour which followed
      Penrod's first sight of himself as the Child Sir Lancelot. But Mr. Wilson
      himself, dastard but eloquent foe of Harold Ramorez, could not have
      expressed, with all the vile dashes at his command, the sentiments which
      animated Penrod's bosom when the instantaneous and unalterable conviction
      descended upon him that he was intended by his loved ones to make a public
      spectacle of himself in his sister's stockings and part of an old dress of
      his mother's.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him these familiar things were not disguised at all; there seemed no
      possibility that the whole world would not know them at a glance. The
      stockings were worse than the bodice. He had been assured that these could
      not be recognized, but, seeing them in the mirror, he was sure that no
      human eye could fail at first glance to detect the difference between
      himself and the former purposes of these stockings. Fold, wrinkle, and
      void shrieked their history with a hundred tongues, invoking earthquake,
      eclipse, and blue ruin. The frantic youth's final submission was obtained
      only after a painful telephonic conversation between himself and his
      father, the latter having been called up and upon, by the exhausted Mrs.
      Schofield, to subjugate his offspring by wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies made all possible haste, after this, to deliver Penrod into
      the hands of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; nevertheless, they found opportunity to
      exchange earnest congratulations upon his not having recognized the humble
      but serviceable paternal garment now brilliant about the Lancelotish
      middle. Altogether, they felt that the costume was a success. Penrod
      looked like nothing ever remotely imagined by Sir Thomas Malory or Alfred
      Tennyson;&mdash;for that matter, he looked like nothing ever before seen
      on earth; but as Mrs. Schofield and Margaret took their places in the
      audience at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall, the anxiety they felt
      concerning Penrod's elocutionary and gesticular powers, so soon to be put
      to public test, was pleasantly tempered by their satisfaction that, owing
      to their efforts, his outward appearance would be a credit to the family.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV DESPERATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom behind the stage&mdash;a
      room crowded with excited children, all about equally medieval and
      artistic. Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought himself, but he was
      so preoccupied with his own shame, steeling his nerves to meet the first
      inevitable taunting reference to his sister's stockings, that he failed to
      perceive there were others present in much of his own unmanned condition.
      Retiring to a corner, immediately upon his entrance, he managed to
      unfasten the mantle at the shoulders, and, drawing it round him, pinned it
      again at his throat so that it concealed the rest of his costume. This
      permitted a temporary relief, but increased his horror of the moment when,
      in pursuance of the action of the &ldquo;pageant,&rdquo; the sheltering garment must
      be cast aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close
      about them. A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics from their
      shoulders, airily, showing off hired splendours from a professional
      costumer's stock, while one or two were insulting examples of parental
      indulgence, particularly little Maurice Levy, the Child Sir Galahad. This
      shrinking person went clamorously about, making it known everywhere that
      the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great sum into constructing
      his costume. It consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers, a white satin
      waistcoat, and a beautifully cut little swallow-tailed coat with pearl
      buttons. The medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle of
      yellow velvet, and little white boots, sporting gold tassels.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the Child Sir
      Lancelot, gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of little
      girls. Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>you </i>got on?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Levy, after dispensing information.
      &ldquo;What you got on under that ole golf cape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked upon him coldly. At other times his questioner would have
      approached him with deference, even with apprehension. But to-day the
      Child Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>you</i> got on?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin',&rdquo; said Penrod, with an indifference assumed at great cost to
      his nervous system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elate Maurice was inspired to set up as a wit. &ldquo;Then you're nakid!&rdquo; he
      shouted exultantly. &ldquo;Penrod Schofield says he hasn't got nothin' on under
      that ole golf cape! He's nakid! He's nakid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly, and a javelin pierced the
      inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine, amber-curled and
      beautiful Marjorie Jones, lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other boys and girls came flocking to the uproar. &ldquo;He's nakid, he's
      nakid!&rdquo; shrieked the Child Sir Galahad. &ldquo;Penrod Schofield's nakid! He's <i>na-a-a-kid</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; said Mrs. Lora Rewbush, pushing her way into the group.
      &ldquo;Remember, we are all little knights and ladies to-day. Little knights and
      ladies of the Table Round would not make so much noise. Now children, we
      must begin to take our places on the stage. Is everybody here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion: he slid behind Mrs.
      Lora Rewbush, and being near a door, opened it unnoticed and went out
      quickly, closing it behind him. He found himself in a narrow and vacant
      hallway which led to a door marked &ldquo;Janitor's Room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burning with outrage, heart-sick at the sweet, cold-blooded laughter of
      Marjorie Jones, Penrod rested his elbows upon a window-sill and speculated
      upon the effects of a leap from the second story. One of the reasons he
      gave it up was his desire to live on Maurice Levy's account: already he
      was forming educational plans for the Child Sir Galahad.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stout man in blue overalls passed through the hallway muttering to
      himself petulantly. &ldquo;I reckon they'll find that hall hot enough <i>now</i>!&rdquo;
       he said, conveying to Penrod an impression that some too feminine women
      had sent him upon an unreasonable errand to the furnace. He went into the
      Janitor's Room and, emerging a moment later, minus the overalls, passed
      Penrod again with a bass rumble&mdash;&ldquo;Dern 'em!&rdquo; it seemed he said&mdash;and
      made a gloomy exit by the door at the upper end of the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conglomerate and delicate rustle of a large, mannerly audience was
      heard as the janitor opened and closed the door; and stage-fright seized
      the boy. The orchestra began an overture, and, at that, Penrod, trembling
      violently, tiptoed down the hall into the Janitor's Room. It was a
      cul-de-sac: There was no outlet save by the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despairingly he doffed his mantle and looked down upon himself for a last
      sickening assurance that the stockings were as obviously and disgracefully
      Margaret's as they had seemed in the mirror at home. For a moment he was
      encouraged: perhaps he was no worse than some of the other boys. Then he
      noticed that a safety-pin had opened; one of those connecting the
      stockings with his trunks. He sat down to fasten it and his eye fell for
      the first time with particular attention upon the trunks. Until this
      instant he had been preoccupied with the stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Schofields' house stood on a corner at the intersection of two
      main-travelled streets; the fence was low, and the publicity obtained by
      the washable portion of the family apparel, on Mondays, had often been
      painful to Penrod; for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness in these
      matters. A plain, matter-of-fact washerwoman' employed by Mrs. Schofield,
      never left anything to the imagination of the passer-by; and of all her
      calm display the scarlet flaunting of his father's winter wear had most
      abashed Penrod. One day Marjorie Jones, all gold and starch, had passed
      when the dreadful things were on the line: Penrod had hidden himself,
      shuddering. The whole town, he was convinced, knew these garments
      intimately and derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he sat in the janitor's chair, the horrible and paralyzing
      recognition came. He had not an instant's doubt that every fellow actor,
      as well as every soul in the audience, would recognize what his mother and
      sister had put upon him. For as the awful truth became plain to himself it
      seemed blazoned to the world; and far, far louder than the stockings, the
      trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret: <i>whose </i>they were and <i>what
      </i>they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding themselves
      very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed people, and
      such dreamers' sensations are comparable to Penrod's, though faintly,
      because Penrod was awake and in much too full possession of the most
      active capacities for anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      A human male whose dress has been damaged, or reveals some vital lack,
      suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every second
      absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and species;
      and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in his struggle
      to attain that condition. Also, there is absolutely no embarrassment
      possible to a woman which is comparable to that of a man under
      corresponding circumstances and in this a boy is a man. Gazing upon the
      ghastly trunks, the stricken Penrod felt that he was a degree worse then
      nude; and a great horror of himself filled his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door into the hallway opened, and a voice demanded him. He could not
      be seen from the hallway, but the hue and the cry was up; and he knew he
      must be taken. It was only a question of seconds. He huddled in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lora Rewbush angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distracted boy rose and, as he did so, a long pin sank deep into his
      back. He extracted it frenziedly, which brought to his ears a protracted
      and sonorous ripping, too easily located by a final gesture of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; Mrs. Lora Rewbush had come out into the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in this extremity, when all seemed lost indeed, particularly
      including honour, the dilating eye of the outlaw fell upon the blue
      overalls which the janitor had left hanging upon a peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspiration and action were almost simultaneous.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V THE PAGEANT OF THE TABLE ROUND
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; Mrs. Lora Rewbush stood in the doorway, indignantly gazing upon
      a Child Sir Lancelot mantled to the heels. &ldquo;Do you know that you have kept
      an audience of five hundred people waiting for ten minutes?&rdquo; She, also,
      detained the five hundred while she spake further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod contentedly, as he followed her toward the buzzing
      stage, &ldquo;I was just sitting there thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later the curtain rose on a medieval castle hall richly done
      in the new stage-craft made in Germany and consisting of pink and blue
      cheesecloth. The Child King Arthur and the Child Queen Guinevere were
      disclosed upon thrones, with the Child Elaine and many other celebrities
      in attendance; while about fifteen Child Knights were seated at a
      dining-room table round, which was covered with a large Oriental rug, and
      displayed (for the knights' refreshment) a banquet service of silver
      loving-cups and trophies, borrowed from the Country Club and some local
      automobile manufacturers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this splendour, potted plants and palms have seldom been
      more lavishly used in any castle on the stage or off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footlights were aided by a &ldquo;spot-light&rdquo; from the rear of the hall; and
      the children were revealed in a blaze of glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hushed, multitudinous &ldquo;O-OH&rdquo; of admiration came from the decorous and
      delighted audience. Then the children sang feebly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Chuldrun of the Tabul Round,
     Lit-tul knights and ladies we.
     Let our voy-siz all resound
     Faith and hope and charitee!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Child King Arthur rose, extended his sceptre with the decisive gesture
      of a semaphore, and spake:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Each littul knight and lady born
     Has noble deeds <i>to </i>perform
     In <i>thee </i>child-world of shivullree,
     No matter how small his share may be.
     Let each advance and tell in turn
     What claim has each to knighthood earn.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Child Sir Mordred, the villain of this piece, rose in his place at the
      table round, and piped the only lines ever written by Mrs. Lora Rewbush
      which Penrod Schofield could have pronounced without loathing. Georgie
      Bassett, a really angelic boy, had been selected for the role of Mordred.
      His perfect conduct had earned for him the sardonic sobriquet, &ldquo;The Little
      Gentleman,&rdquo; among his boy acquaintances. (Naturally he had no friends.)
      Hence the other boys supposed that he had been selected for the wicked
      Mordred as a reward of virtue. He declaimed serenely:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I hight Sir Mordred the Child, and I teach
     Lessons of selfishest evil, and reach
     Out into darkness.  Thoughtless, unkind,
     And ruthless is Mordred, and unrefined.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Child Mordred was properly rebuked and denied the accolade, though,
      like the others, he seemed to have assumed the title already. He made a
      plotter's exit. Whereupon Maurice Levy rose, bowed, announced that he
      highted the Child Sir Galahad, and continued with perfect sang-froid:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I am the purest of the pure.
     I have but kindest thoughts each day.
     I give my riches to the poor,
     And follow in the Master's way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur, and he bade
      Maurice &ldquo;stand forth&rdquo; and come near the throne, a command obeyed with the
      easy grace of conscious merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Penrod's turn. He stepped back from his chair, the table between
      him and the audience, and began in a high, breathless monotone:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child,
     Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild.
     What though I'm <i>but </i>a littul child,
     Gentul-heartud, meek, and mild,
     I do my share though but&mdash;though but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Penrod paused and gulped. The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was heard from
      the wings, prompting irritably, and the Child. Sir Lancelot repeated:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I do my share though but&mdash;though but a tot,
     I pray you knight Sir Lancelot!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This also met the royal favour, and Penrod was bidden to join Sir Galahad
      at the throne. As he crossed the stage, Mrs. Schofield whispered to
      Margaret:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy! He's unpinned his mantle and fixed it to cover his whole
      costume. After we worked so hard to make it becoming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; he'll have to take the cape off in a minute,&rdquo; returned
      Margaret. She leaned forward suddenly, narrowing her eyes to see better.
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> that thing hanging about his left ankle?&rdquo; she whispered
      uneasily. &ldquo;How queer! He must have got tangled in something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Schofield, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His left foot. It makes him stumble. Don't you see? It looks&mdash;it
      looks like an elephant's foot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Child Sir Lancelot and the Child Sir Galahad clasped hands before
      their Child King. Penrod was conscious of a great uplift; in a moment he
      would have to throw aside his mantle, but even so he was protected and
      sheltered in the human garment of a man. His stage-fright had passed, for
      the audience was but an indistinguishable blur of darkness beyond the
      dazzling lights. His most repulsive speech (that in which he proclaimed
      himself a &ldquo;tot&rdquo;) was over and done with; and now at last the small, moist
      hand of the Child Sir Galahad lay within his own. Craftily his brown
      fingers stole from Maurice's palm to the wrist. The two boys declaimed in
      concert:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;We are two chuldrun of the Tabul Round
     Strewing kindness all a-round.
     With love and good deeds striving ever for the best,
     May our littul efforts e'er be blest.
     Two littul hearts we offer.  See
     United in love, faith, hope, and char&mdash;OW!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The conclusion of the duet was marred. The Child Sir Galahad suddenly
      stiffened, and, uttering an irrepressible shriek of anguish, gave a brief
      exhibition of the contortionist's art. (&ldquo;HE'S TWISTIN' MY WRIST! DERN YOU,
      LEGGO!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Mrs. Lora Rewbush was again heard from the wings; it sounded
      bloodthirsty. Penrod released his victim; and the Child King Arthur,
      somewhat disconcerted, extended his sceptre and, with the assistance of
      the enraged prompter, said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Sweet child-friends of the Tabul Round,
     In brotherly love and kindness abound,
     Sir Lancelot, you have spoken well,
     Sir Galahad, too, as clear as bell.
     So now pray doff your mantles gay.
     You shall be knighted this very day.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And Penrod doffed his mantle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, a thick and vasty gasp came from the audience, as from
      five hundred bathers in a wholly unexpected surf. This gasp was punctuated
      irregularly, over the auditorium, by imperfectly subdued screams both of
      dismay and incredulous joy, and by two dismal shrieks. Altogether it was
      an extraordinary sound, a sound never to be forgotten by any one who heard
      it. It was almost as unforgettable as the sight which caused it; the word
      &ldquo;sight&rdquo; being here used in its vernacular sense, for Penrod, standing
      unmantled and revealed in all the medieval and artistic glory of the
      janitor's blue overalls, falls within its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The janitor was a heavy man, and his overalls, upon Penrod, were merely
      oceanic. The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue gulfs and
      vast saggings; and the left leg, too hastily rolled up, had descended with
      a distinctively elephantine effect, as Margaret had observed. Certainly,
      the Child Sir Lancelot was at least a sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had, even then, a
      consciousness that they were looking on at History in the Making. A
      supreme act is recognizable at sight: it bears the birthmark of
      immortality. But Penrod, that marvellous boy, had begun to declaim, even
      with the gesture of flinging off his mantle for the accolade:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I first, the Child Sir Lancelot du Lake,
     Will volunteer to knighthood take,
     And kneeling here before your throne
     I vow to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He finished his speech unheard. The audience had recovered breath, but had
      lost self-control, and there ensued something later described by a
      participant as a sort of cultured riot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actors in the &ldquo;pageant&rdquo; were not so dumfounded by Penrod's costume as
      might have been expected. A few precocious geniuses perceived that the
      overalls were the Child Lancelot's own comment on maternal intentions; and
      these were profoundly impressed: they regarded him with the grisly
      admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jail-mate about to be
      distinguished by hanging. But most of the children simply took it to be
      the case (a little strange, but not startling) that Penrod's mother had
      dressed him like that&mdash;which is pathetic. They tried to go on with
      the &ldquo;pageant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made a brief, manful effort. But the irrepressible outbursts from the
      audience bewildered them; every time Sir Lancelot du Lake the Child opened
      his mouth, the great, shadowy house fell into an uproar, and the children
      into confusion. Strong women and brave girls in the audience went out into
      the lobby, shrieking and clinging to one another. Others remained, rocking
      in their seats, helpless and spent. The neighbourhood of Mrs. Schofield
      and Margaret became, tactfully, a desert. Friends of the author went
      behind the scenes and encountered a hitherto unknown phase of Mrs. Lora
      Rewbush; they said, afterward, that she hardly seemed to know what she was
      doing. She begged to be left alone somewhere with Penrod Schofield, for
      just a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      They led her away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI EVENING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun was setting behind the back fence (though at a considerable
      distance) as Penrod Schofield approached that fence and looked
      thoughtfully up at the top of it, apparently having in mind some purpose
      to climb up and sit there. Debating this, he passed his fingers gently up
      and down the backs of his legs; and then something seemed to decide him
      not to sit anywhere. He leaned against the fence, sighed profoundly, and
      gazed at Duke, his wistful dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sigh was reminiscent: episodes of simple pathos were passing before
      his inward eye. About the most painful was the vision of lovely Marjorie
      Jones, weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot was dragged, insatiate,
      from the prostrate and howling Child Sir Galahad, after an onslaught
      delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall upon the
      demoralized &ldquo;pageant.&rdquo; And then&mdash;oh, pangs! oh, woman!&mdash;she
      slapped at the ruffian's cheek, as he was led past her by a resentful
      janitor; and turning, flung her arms round the Child Sir Galahad's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PENROD SCHOFIELD, DON'T YOU DARE EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU
      LIVE!&rdquo; Maurice's little white boots and gold tassels had done their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked
      clothes-closet pending the arrival of his father. Mr. Schofield came and,
      shortly after, there was put into practice an old patriarchal custom. It
      is a custom of inconceivable antiquity: probably primordial, certainly
      prehistoric, but still in vogue in some remaining citadels of the ancient
      simplicities of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, therefore, in the dusk, Penrod leaned against the fence and
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His case is comparable to that of an adult who could have survived a
      similar experience. Looking back to the sawdust-box, fancy pictures this
      comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in congenial
      literary activities in a private retreat. We see this period marked by the
      creation of some of the most virile passages of a Work dealing exclusively
      in red corpuscles and huge primal impulses. We see this thoughtful man
      dragged from his calm seclusion to a horrifying publicity; forced to adopt
      the stage and, himself a writer, compelled to exploit the repulsive
      sentiments of an author not only personally distasteful to him but whose
      whole method and school in belles lettres he despises.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair of
      overalls. We conceive him to have ruined, then, his own reputation, and to
      have utterly disgraced his family; next, to have engaged in the duello and
      to have been spurned by his lady-love, thus lost to him (according to her
      own declaration) forever. Finally, we must behold: imprisonment by the
      authorities; the third degree and flagellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps too eventful.
      Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent
      fulness of life, for, as he leaned against the fence, gazing upon his
      wistful Duke, he sighed again and murmured aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WELL, HASN'T THIS BEEN A DAY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in a little while a star came out, freshly lighted, from the highest
      part of the sky, and Penrod, looking up, noticed it casually and a little
      drowsily. He yawned. Then he sighed once more, but not reminiscently:
      evening had come; the day was over. It was a sigh of pure ennui.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII EVILS OF DRINK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day, Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process which was
      without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon. When the teacher
      of his class in Sunday-school requested the weekly contribution, Penrod,
      fumbling honestly (at first) in the wrong pockets, managed to look so
      embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind, and said she was
      often forgetful herself. She was so sweet about it that, looking into the
      future, Penrod began to feel confident of a small but regular income.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home, but proceeded
      to squander the funds just withheld from China upon an orgy of the most
      pungently forbidden description. In a Drug Emporium, near the church, he
      purchased a five-cent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the
      heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle, but undeniably substantial, and
      so generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs
      be avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his money's worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equipped with this collation, Penrod contributed his remaining nickel to a
      picture show, countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not the
      moral authorities. Here, in cozy darkness, he placidly insulted his liver
      with jaw-breaker upon jaw-breaker from the paper sack, and in a surfeit of
      content watched the silent actors on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One film made a lasting impression upon him. It depicted with relentless
      pathos the drunkard's progress; beginning with his conversion to beer in
      the company of loose travelling men; pursuing him through an inexplicable
      lapse into evening clothes and the society of some remarkably painful
      ladies, next, exhibiting the effects of alcohol on the victim's domestic
      disposition, the unfortunate man was seen in the act of striking his wife
      and, subsequently, his pleading baby daughter with an abnormally heavy
      walking-stick. Their flight&mdash;through the snow&mdash;to seek the
      protection of a relative was shown, and finally, the drunkard's
      picturesque behaviour at the portals of a madhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      So fascinated was Penrod that he postponed his departure until this film
      came round again, by which time he had finished his unnatural repast and
      almost, but not quite, decided against following the profession of a
      drunkard when he grew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging, satiated, from the theatre, a public timepiece before a
      jeweller's shop confronted him with an unexpected dial and imminent
      perplexities. How was he to explain at home these hours of dalliance?
      There was a steadfast rule that he return direct from Sunday-school; and
      Sunday rules were important, because on that day there was his father,
      always at home and at hand, perilously ready for action. One of the
      hardest conditions of boyhood is the almost continuous strain put upon the
      powers of invention by the constant and harassing necessity for
      explanations of every natural act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding homeward through the deepening twilight as rapidly as possible,
      at a gait half skip and half canter, Penrod made up his mind in what
      manner he would account for his long delay, and, as he drew nearer,
      rehearsed in words the opening passage of his defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here,&rdquo; he determined to begin; &ldquo;I do not wished to be blamed for
      things I couldn't help, nor any other boy. I was going along the street by
      a cottage and a lady put her head out of the window and said her husband
      was drunk and whipping her and her little girl, and she asked me wouldn't
      I come in and help hold him. So I went in and tried to get hold of this
      drunken lady's husband where he was whipping their baby daughter, but he
      wouldn't pay any attention, and I TOLD her I ought to be getting home, but
      she kep' on askin' me to stay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point he reached the corner of his own yard, where a coincidence
      not only checked the rehearsal of his eloquence but happily obviated all
      occasion for it. A cab from the station drew up in front of the gate, and
      there descended a troubled lady in black and a fragile little girl about
      three. Mrs. Schofield rushed from the house and enfolded both in
      hospitable arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were Penrod's Aunt Clara and cousin, also Clara, from Dayton,
      Illinois, and in the flurry of their arrival everybody forgot to put
      Penrod to the question. It is doubtful, however, if he felt any relief;
      there may have been even a slight, unconscious disappointment not
      altogether dissimilar to that of an actor deprived of a good part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of some really necessary preparations for dinner he stepped
      from the bathroom into the pink-and-white bedchamber of his sister, and
      addressed her rather thickly through a towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When'd mamma find out Aunt Clara and Cousin Clara were coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till she saw them from the window. She just happened to look out as
      they drove up. Aunt Clara telegraphed this morning, but it wasn't
      delivered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long they goin' to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod ceased to rub his shining face, and thoughtfully tossed the towel
      through the bathroom door. &ldquo;Uncle John won't try to make 'em come back
      home, I guess, will he?&rdquo; (Uncle John was Aunt Clara's husband, a
      successful manufacturer of stoves, and his lifelong regret was that he had
      not entered the Baptist ministry.) &ldquo;He'll let 'em stay here quietly, won't
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ARE you talking about?&rdquo; demanded Margaret, turning from her mirror.
      &ldquo;Uncle John sent them here. Why shouldn't he let them stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked crestfallen. &ldquo;Then he hasn't taken to drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; She emphasized the denial with a pretty peal of soprano
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; asked her brother gloomily, &ldquo;why did Aunt Clara look so
      worried when she got here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Don't people worry about anything except somebody's
      drinking? Where did you get such an idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;you don't KNOW it ain't that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again, wholeheartedly. &ldquo;Poor Uncle John! He won't even allow
      grape juice or ginger ale in his house. They came because they were afraid
      little Clara might catch the measles. She's very delicate, and there's
      such an epidemic of measles among the children over in Dayton the schools
      had to be closed. Uncle John got so worried that last night he dreamed
      about it; and this morning he couldn't stand it any longer and packed them
      off over here, though he thinks its wicked to travel on Sunday. And Aunt
      Clara was worried when she got here because they'd forgotten to check her
      trunk and it will have to be sent by express. Now what in the name of the
      common sense put it into your head that Uncle John had taken to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo; He turned lifelessly away and went downstairs, a new-born
      hope dying in his bosom. Life seems so needlessly dull sometimes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII SCHOOL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning, when he had once more resumed the dreadful burden of
      education, it seemed infinitely duller. And yet what pleasanter sight is
      there than a schoolroom well filled with children of those sprouting years
      just before the 'teens? The casual visitor, gazing from the teacher's
      platform upon these busy little heads, needs only a blunted memory to
      experience the most agreeable and exhilarating sensations. Still, for the
      greater part, the children are unconscious of the happiness of their
      condition; for nothing is more pathetically true than that we &ldquo;never know
      when we are well off.&rdquo; The boys in a public school are less aware of their
      happy state than are the girls; and of all the boys in his room, probably
      Penrod himself had the least appreciation of his felicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring at an open page of a textbook, but not studying; not even
      reading; not even thinking. Nor was he lost in a reverie: his mind's eye
      was shut, as his physical eye might well have been, for the optic nerve,
      flaccid with ennui, conveyed nothing whatever of the printed page upon
      which the orb of vision was partially focused. Penrod was doing something
      very unusual and rare, something almost never accomplished except by
      coloured people or by a boy in school on a spring day: he was doing really
      nothing at all. He was merely a state of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the street a sound stole in through the open window, and abhorring
      Nature began to fill the vacuum called Penrod Schofield; for the sound was
      the spring song of a mouth-organ, coming down the sidewalk. The windows
      were intentionally above the level of the eyes of the seated pupils; but
      the picture of the musician was plain to Penrod, painted for him by a
      quality in the runs and trills, partaking of the oboe, of the calliope,
      and of cats in anguish; an excruciating sweetness obtained only by the
      wallowing, walloping yellow-pink palm of a hand whose back was Congo black
      and shiny. The music came down the street and passed beneath the window,
      accompanied by the care-free shuffling of a pair of old shoes scuffing
      syncopations on the cement sidewalk. It passed into the distance; became
      faint and blurred; was gone. Emotion stirred in Penrod a great and
      poignant desire, but (perhaps fortunately) no fairy godmother made her
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise Penrod would have gone down the street in a black skin, playing
      the mouth-organ, and an unprepared coloured youth would have found himself
      enjoying educational advantages for which he had no ambition whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused from perfect apathy, the boy cast about the schoolroom an eye
      wearied to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher upon the
      platform, the backs of the heads of the pupils in front of him, and the
      monotonous stretches of blackboard threateningly defaced by arithmetical
      formulae and other insignia of torture. Above the blackboard, the walls of
      the high room were of white plaster&mdash;white with the qualified
      whiteness of old snow in a soft coal town. This dismal expanse was broken
      by four lithographic portraits, votive offerings of a thoughtful
      publisher. The portraits were of good and great men, kind men; men who
      loved children. Their faces were noble and benevolent. But the lithographs
      offered the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by the everlasting
      sameness of the schoolroom. Long day after long day, interminable week in
      and interminable week out, vast month on vast month, the pupils sat with
      those four portraits beaming kindness down upon them. The faces became
      permanent in the consciousness of the children; they became an obsession&mdash;in
      and out of school the children were never free of them. The four faces
      haunted the minds of children falling asleep; they hung upon the minds of
      children waking at night; they rose forebodingly in the minds of children
      waking in the morning; they became monstrously alive in the minds of
      children lying sick of fever. Never, while the children of that schoolroom
      lived, would they be able to forget one detail of the four lithographs:
      the hand of Longfellow was fixed, for them, forever, in his beard. And by
      a simple and unconscious association of ideas, Penrod Schofield was
      accumulating an antipathy for the gentle Longfellow and for James Russell
      Lowell and for Oliver Wendell Holmes and for John Greenleaf Whittier,
      which would never permit him to peruse a work of one of those great New
      Englanders without a feeling of personal resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes fell slowly and inimically from the brow of Whittier to the braid
      of reddish hair belonging to Victorine Riordan, the little octoroon girl
      who sat directly in front of him. Victorine's back was as familiar to
      Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell Holmes. So was her gayly coloured
      plaid waist. He hated the waist as he hated Victorine herself, without
      knowing why. Enforced companionship in large quantities and on an equal
      basis between the sexes appears to sterilize the affections, and
      schoolroom romances are few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victorine's hair was thick, and the brickish glints in it were beautiful,
      but Penrod was very tired of it. A tiny knot of green ribbon finished off
      the braid and kept it from unravelling; and beneath the ribbon there was a
      final wisp of hair which was just long enough to repose upon Penrod's desk
      when Victorine leaned back in her seat. It was there now. Thoughtfully, he
      took the braid between thumb and forefinger, and, without disturbing
      Victorine, dipped the end of it and the green ribbon into the inkwell of
      his desk. He brought hair and ribbon forth dripping purple ink, and
      partially dried them on a blotter, though, a moment later when Victorine
      leaned forward, they were still able to add a few picturesque touches to
      the plaid waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rudolph Krauss, across the aisle from Penrod, watched the operation with
      protuberant eyes, fascinated. Inspired to imitation, he took a piece of
      chalk from his pocket and wrote &ldquo;RATS&rdquo; across the shoulder-blades of the
      boy in front of him, then looked across appealingly to Penrod for tokens
      of congratulation. Penrod yawned. It may not be denied that at times he
      appeared to be a very self-centred boy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX SOARING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half the members of the class passed out to a recitation-room, the
      empurpled Victorine among them, and Miss Spence started the remaining half
      through the ordeal of trial by mathematics. Several boys and girls were
      sent to the blackboard, and Penrod, spared for the moment, followed their
      operations a little while with his eyes, but not with his mind; then,
      sinking deeper in his seat, limply abandoned the effort. His eyes remained
      open, but saw nothing; the routine of the arithmetic lesson reached his
      ears in familiar, meaningless sounds, but he heard nothing; and yet, this
      time, he was profoundly occupied. He had drifted away from the painful
      land of facts, and floated now in a new sea of fancy which he had just
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maturity forgets the marvellous realness of a boy's day-dreams, how
      colourful they glow, rosy and living, and how opaque the curtain closing
      down between the dreamer and the actual world. That curtain is almost
      sound-proof, too, and causes more throat-trouble among parents than is
      suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable
      longing for something astonishing to happen, and as every boy's
      fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself, so as to be the
      centre of all human interest and awe, it was natural that Penrod should
      discover in fancy the delightful secret of self-levitation. He found, in
      this curious series of imaginings, during the lesson in arithmetic, that
      the atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under water, but with
      infinitely greater ease and with perfect comfort in breathing. In his mind
      he extended his arms gracefully, at a level with his shoulders, and
      delicately paddled the air with his hands, which at once caused him to be
      drawn up out of his seat and elevated gently to a position about midway
      between the floor and the ceiling, where he came to an equilibrium and
      floated; a sensation not the less exquisite because of the screams of his
      fellow pupils, appalled by the miracle. Miss Spence herself was amazed and
      frightened, but he only smiled down carelessly upon her when she commanded
      him to return to earth; and then, when she climbed upon a desk to pull him
      down, he quietly paddled himself a little higher, leaving his toes just
      out of her reach. Next, he swam through a few slow somersaults to show his
      mastery of the new art, and, with the shouting of the dumfounded scholars
      ringing in his ears, turned on his side and floated swiftly out of the
      window, immediately rising above the housetops, while people in the street
      below him shrieked, and a trolley car stopped dead in wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With almost no exertion he paddled himself, many yards at a stroke, to the
      girls' private school where Marjorie Jones was a pupil&mdash;Marjorie
      Jones of the amber curls and the golden voice! Long before the &ldquo;Pageant of
      the Table Round,&rdquo; she had offered Penrod a hundred proofs that she
      considered him wholly undesirable and ineligible. At the Friday Afternoon
      Dancing Class she consistently incited and led the laughter at him
      whenever Professor Bartet singled him out for admonition in matters of
      feet and decorum. And but yesterday she had chid him for his slavish lack
      of memory in daring to offer her a greeting on the way to Sunday-school.
      &ldquo;Well! I expect you must forgot I told you never to speak to me again! If
      I was a boy, I'd be too proud to come hanging around people that don't
      speak to me, even if I WAS the Worst Boy in Town!&rdquo; So she flouted him. But
      now, as he floated in through the window of her classroom and swam gently
      along the ceiling like an escaped toy balloon, she fell upon her knees
      beside her little desk, and, lifting up her arms toward him, cried with
      love and admiration:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, PENrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He negligently kicked a globe from the high chandelier, and, smiling
      coldly, floated out through the hall to the front steps of the school,
      while Marjorie followed, imploring him to grant her one kind look.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street an enormous crowd had gathered, headed by Miss Spence and a
      brass band; and a cheer from a hundred thousand throats shook the very
      ground as Penrod swam overhead. Marjorie knelt upon the steps and watched
      adoringly while Penrod took the drum-major's baton and, performing sinuous
      evolutions above the crowd, led the band. Then he threw the baton so high
      that it disappeared from sight; but he went swiftly after it, a double
      delight, for he had not only the delicious sensation of rocketing safely
      up and up into the blue sky, but also that of standing in the crowd below,
      watching and admiring himself as he dwindled to a speck, disappeared and
      then, emerging from a cloud, came speeding down, with the baton in his
      hand, to the level of the treetops, where he beat time for the band and
      the vast throng and Marjorie Jones, who all united in the &ldquo;Star-spangled
      Banner&rdquo; in honour of his aerial achievements. It was a great moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great moment, but something seemed to threaten it. The face of
      Miss Spence looking up from the crowd grew too vivid&mdash;unpleasantly
      vivid. She was beckoning him and shouting, &ldquo;Come down, Penrod Schofield!
      Penrod Schofield, come down here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could hear her above the band and the singing of the multitude; she
      seemed intent on spoiling everything. Marjorie Jones was weeping to show
      how sorry she was that she had formerly slighted him, and throwing kisses
      to prove that she loved him; but Miss Spence kept jumping between him and
      Marjorie, incessantly calling his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew more and more irritated with her; he was the most important person
      in the world and was engaged in proving it to Marjorie Jones and the whole
      city, and yet Miss Spence seemed to feel she still had the right to order
      him about as she did in the old days when he was an ordinary schoolboy. He
      was furious; he was sure she wanted him to do something disagreeable. It
      seemed to him that she had screamed &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; thousands of
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the beginning of his aerial experiments in his own schoolroom, he had
      not opened his lips, knowing somehow that one of the requirements for air
      floating is perfect silence on the part of the floater; but, finally,
      irritated beyond measure by Miss Spence's clamorous insistence, he was
      unable to restrain an indignant rebuke and immediately came to earth with
      a frightful bump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence&mdash;in the flesh&mdash;had directed toward the physical body
      of the absent Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences of
      dividing seventeen apples, fairly, among three boys, and she was surprised
      and displeased to receive no answer although to the best of her knowledge
      and belief, he was looking fixedly at her. She repeated her question
      crisply, without visible effect; then summoned him by name with increasing
      asperity. Twice she called him, while all his fellow pupils turned to
      stare at the gazing boy. She advanced a step from the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly. &ldquo;Can't you keep still a MINUTE?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X UNCLE JOHN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Miss Spence gasped. So did the pupils.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The whole room filled with a swelling conglomerate &ldquo;O-O-O-O-H!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Penrod himself, the walls reeled with the shock. He sat with his
      mouth open, a mere lump of stupefaction. For the appalling words that he
      had hurled at the teacher were as inexplicable to him as to any other who
      heard them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more treacherous than the human mind; nothing else so loves to
      play the Iscariot. Even when patiently bullied into a semblance of order
      and training, it may prove but a base and shifty servant. And Penrod's
      mind was not his servant; it was a master, with the April wind's whims;
      and it had just played him a diabolical trick. The very jolt with which he
      came back to the schoolroom in the midst of his fancied flight jarred his
      day-dream utterly out of him; and he sat, open-mouthed in horror at what
      he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unanimous gasp of awe was protracted. Miss Spence, however, finally
      recovered her breath, and, returning deliberately to the platform, faced
      the school. &ldquo;And then for a little while,&rdquo; as pathetic stories sometimes
      recount, &ldquo;everything was very still.&rdquo; It was so still, in fact, that
      Penrod's newborn notoriety could almost be heard growing. This grisly
      silence was at last broken by the teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield, stand up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The miserable child obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by speaking to me in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hung his head, raked the floor with the side of his shoe, swayed,
      swallowed, looked suddenly at his hands with the air of never having seen
      them before, then clasped them behind him. The school shivered in ecstatic
      horror, every fascinated eye upon him; yet there was not a soul in the
      room but was profoundly grateful to him for the sensation&mdash;including
      the offended teacher herself. Unhappily, all this gratitude was
      unconscious and altogether different from the kind which, results in
      testimonials and loving-cups. On the contrary!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gulped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me at once! Why did you speak to me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He choked, unable to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just&mdash;thinking,&rdquo; he managed to stammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will not do,&rdquo; she returned sharply. &ldquo;I wish to know immediately why
      you spoke as you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stricken Penrod answered helplessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was just thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the very rack he could have offered no ampler truthful explanation.
      It was all he knew about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence's expression gave evidence that her power of self-restraint
      was undergoing a remarkable test. However, after taking counsel with
      herself, she commanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shuffled forward, and she placed a chair upon the platform near her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then (but not at all as if nothing had happened), she continued the lesson
      in arithmetic. Spiritually the children may have learned a lesson in very
      small fractions indeed as they gazed at the fragment of sin before them on
      the stool of penitence. They all stared at him attentively with hard and
      passionately interested eyes, in which there was never one trace of pity.
      It cannot be said with precision that he writhed; his movement was more a
      slow, continuous squirm, effected with a ghastly assumption of languid
      indifference; while his gaze, in the effort to escape the marble-hearted
      glare of his schoolmates, affixed itself with apparent permanence to the
      waistcoat button of James Russell Lowell just above the &ldquo;U&rdquo; in &ldquo;Russell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Classes came and classes went, grilling him with eyes. Newcomers received
      the story of the crime in darkling whispers; and the outcast sat and sat
      and sat, and squirmed and squirmed and squirmed. (He did one or two things
      with his spine which a professional contortionist would have observed with
      real interest.) And all this while of freezing suspense was but the
      criminal's detention awaiting trial. A known punishment may be anticipated
      with some measure of equanimity; at least, the prisoner may prepare
      himself to undergo it; but the unknown looms more monstrous for every
      attempt to guess it. Penrod's crime was unique; there were no rules to aid
      him in estimating the vengeance to fall upon him for it. What seemed most
      probable was that he would be expelled from the schools in the presence of
      his family, the mayor, and council, and afterward whipped by his father
      upon the State House steps, with the entire city as audience by invitation
      of the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon came. The rows of children filed out, every head turning for a last
      unpleasingly speculative look at the outlaw. Then Miss Spence closed the
      door into the cloakroom and that into the big hall, and came and sat at
      her desk, near Penrod. The tramping of feet outside, the shrill calls and
      shouting and the changing voices of the older boys ceased to be heard&mdash;and
      there was silence. Penrod, still affecting to be occupied with Lowell, was
      conscious that Miss Spence looked at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;what excuse have you to offer before I report
      your case to the principal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;principal&rdquo; struck him to the vitals. Grand Inquisitor, Grand
      Khan, Sultan, Emperor, Tsar, Caesar Augustus&mdash;these are comparable.
      He stopped squirming instantly, and sat rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want an answer. Why did you shout those words at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I was just&mdash;thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking what?&rdquo; she asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his left ankle in his right hand and regarded it helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't do, Penrod Schofield,&rdquo; she repeated severely. &ldquo;If that is all
      the excuse you have to offer I shall report your case this instant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she rose with fatal intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod was one of those whom the precipice inspires. &ldquo;Well, I HAVE got
      an excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;she paused impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not an idea, but he felt one coming, and replied automatically, in
      a plaintive tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess anybody that had been through what I had to go through, last
      night, would think they had an excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence resumed her seat, though with the air of being ready to leap
      from it instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has last night to do with your insolence to me this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you'd see,&rdquo; he returned, emphasizing the plaintive note,
      &ldquo;if you knew what I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Penrod,&rdquo; she said, in a kinder voice, &ldquo;I have a high regard for your
      mother and father, and it would hurt me to distress them, but you must
      either tell me what was the matter with you or I'll have to take you to
      Mrs. Houston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain't I going to?&rdquo; he cried, spurred by the dread name. &ldquo;It's
      because I didn't sleep last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you ill?&rdquo; The question was put with some dryness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the dryness. &ldquo;No'm; <i>I</i> wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if someone in your family was so ill that even you were kept up all
      night, how does it happen they let you come to school this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't illness,&rdquo; he returned, shaking his head mournfully. &ldquo;It was
      lots worse'n anybody's being sick. It was&mdash;it was&mdash;well, it was
      jest awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT was?&rdquo; He remarked with anxiety the incredulity in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about Aunt Clara,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Aunt Clara!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Do you mean your mother's sister who
      married Mr. Farry of Dayton, Illinois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Uncle John,&rdquo; returned Penrod sorrowfully. &ldquo;The trouble was
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Spence frowned a frown which he rightly interpreted as one of
      continued suspicion. &ldquo;She and I were in school together,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      used to know her very well, and I've always heard her married life was
      entirely happy. I don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;until last year when Uncle John took to
      running with travelling men&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo; He nodded solemnly. &ldquo;That was what started it. At first he was a
      good, kind husband, but these travelling men would coax him into a saloon
      on his way home from work, and they got him to drinking beer and then
      ales, wines, liquors, and cigars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not inquiring into your Aunt Clara's private affairs; I'm asking you
      if you have anything to say which would palliate&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I'm tryin' to TELL you about, Miss Spence,&rdquo; he pleaded,&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you'd jest only let me. When Aunt Clara and her little baby daughter got
      to our house last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say Mrs. Farry is visiting your mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm&mdash;not just visiting&mdash;you see, she HAD to come. Well of
      course, little baby Clara, she was so bruised up and mauled, where he'd
      been hittin' her with his cane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that your uncle had done such a thing as THAT!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
      Spence, suddenly disarmed by this scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, and mamma and Margaret had to sit up all night nursin' little
      Clara&mdash;and AUNT Clara was in such a state SOMEBODY had to keep
      talkin' to HER, and there wasn't anybody but me to do it, so I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where was your father?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was your father while&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;papa?&rdquo; Penrod paused, reflected; then brightened. &ldquo;Why, he was
      down at the train, waitin' to see if Uncle John would try to follow 'em
      and make 'em come home so's he could persecute 'em some more. I wanted to
      do that, but they said if he did come I mightn't be strong enough to hold
      him and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The brave lad paused again, modestly. Miss Spence's
      expression was encouraging. Her eyes were wide with astonishment, and
      there may have been in them, also, the mingled beginnings of admiration
      and self-reproach. Penrod, warming to his work, felt safer every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I had to sit up with Aunt Clara. She had some
      pretty big bruises, too, and I had to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn't they send for a doctor?&rdquo; However, this question was only a
      flicker of dying incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they didn't want any DOCTOR,&rdquo; exclaimed the inspired realist
      promptly. &ldquo;They don't want anybody to HEAR about it because Uncle John
      might reform&mdash;and then where'd he be if everybody knew he'd been a
      drunkard and whipped his wife and baby daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Miss Spence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he used to be upright as anybody,&rdquo; he went on explanatively. &ldquo;It
      all begun&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Began, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm. It all commenced from the first day he let those travelling men
      coax him into the saloon.&rdquo; Penrod narrated the downfall of his Uncle John
      at length. In detail he was nothing short of plethoric; and incident
      followed incident, sketched with such vividness, such abundance of colour,
      and such verisimilitude to a drunkard's life as a drunkard's life should
      be, that had Miss Spence possessed the rather chilling attributes of
      William J. Burns himself, the last trace of skepticism must have vanished
      from her mind. Besides, there are two things that will be believed of any
      man whatsoever, and one of them is that he has taken to drink. And in
      every sense it was a moving picture which, with simple but eloquent words,
      the virtuous Penrod set before his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eloquence increased with what it fed on; and as with the eloquence so
      with self-reproach in the gentle bosom of the teacher. She cleared her
      throat with difficulty once or twice, during his description of his
      ministering night with Aunt Clara. &ldquo;And I said to her, 'Why, Aunt Clara,
      what's the use of takin' on so about it?' And I said, 'Now, Aunt Clara,
      all the crying in the world can't make things any better.' And then she'd
      just keep catchin' hold of me, and sob and kind of holler, and I'd say,
      'DON'T cry, Aunt Clara&mdash;PLEASE don't cry.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, under the influence of some fragmentary survivals of the respectable
      portion of his Sunday adventures, his theme became more exalted; and, only
      partially misquoting a phrase from a psalm, he related how he had made it
      of comfort to Aunt Clara, and how he had besought her to seek Higher
      guidance in her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprising thing about a structure such as Penrod was erecting is that
      the taller it becomes the more ornamentation it will stand. Gifted boys
      have this faculty of building magnificence upon cobwebs&mdash;and Penrod
      was gifted. Under the spell of his really great performance, Miss Spence
      gazed more and more sweetly upon the prodigy of spiritual beauty and
      goodness before her, until at last, when Penrod came to the explanation of
      his &ldquo;just thinking,&rdquo; she was forced to turn her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, dear,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;that you were all worn out and hardly
      knew what you were saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were thinking about all those dreadful things so hard that you
      forgot where you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;how to save Uncle John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the end of it for this mighty boy was that the teacher kissed him!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI FIDELITY OF A LITTLE DOG
    </h2>
    <p>
      The returning students, that afternoon, observed that Penrod's desk was
      vacant&mdash;and nothing could have been more impressive than that
      sinister mere emptiness. The accepted theory was that Penrod had been
      arrested. How breathtaking, then, the sensation when, at the beginning of
      the second hour, he strolled&mdash;in with inimitable carelessness and,
      rubbing his eyes, somewhat noticeably in the manner of one who has
      snatched an hour of much needed sleep, took his place as if nothing in
      particular had happened. This, at first supposed to be a superhuman
      exhibition of sheer audacity, became but the more dumfounding when Miss
      Spence&mdash;looking up from her desk&mdash;greeted him with a pleasant
      little nod. Even after school, Penrod gave numerous maddened investigators
      no relief. All he would consent to say was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I just TALKED to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mystification not entirely unconnected with the one thus produced was
      manifested at his own family dinner-table the following evening. Aunt
      Clara had been out rather late, and came to the table after the rest were
      seated. She wore a puzzled expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever see Mary Spence nowadays?&rdquo; she inquired, as she unfolded her
      napkin, addressing Mrs. Schofield. Penrod abruptly set down his soup-spoon
      and gazed at his aunt with flattering attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; sometimes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;She's Penrod's teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; said Mrs. Farry. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Do people think
      her a little&mdash;queer, these days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; returned her sister. &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has acquired a very odd manner,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farry decidedly. &ldquo;At
      least, she seemed odd to ME. I met her at the corner just before I got to
      the house, a few minutes ago, and after we'd said howdy-do to each other,
      she kept hold of my hand and looked as though she was going to cry. She
      seemed to be trying to say something, and choking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think that's so very queer, Clara. She knew you in school,
      didn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she hadn't seen you for so many years, I think it's perfectly natural
      she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! She stood there squeezing my hand, and struggling to get her voice&mdash;and
      I got really embarrassed&mdash;and then finally she said, in a kind of
      tearful whisper, 'Be of good cheer&mdash;this trial will pass!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod sighed, and returned somewhat absently to his soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield thoughtfully. &ldquo;Of course she's
      heard about the outbreak of measles in Dayton, since they had to close the
      schools, and she knows you live there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But doesn't it seem a VERY exaggerated way,&rdquo; suggested Margaret, &ldquo;to talk
      about measles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; begged Aunt Clara. &ldquo;After she said that, she said something even
      queerer, and then put her handkerchief to her eyes and hurried away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laid down his spoon again and moved his chair slightly back from
      the table. A spirit of prophecy was upon him: he knew that someone was
      going to ask a question which he felt might better remain unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What WAS the other thing she said?&rdquo; Mr. Schofield inquired, thus
      immediately fulfilling his son's premonition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Farry slowly, looking about the table, &ldquo;she
      said, 'I know that Penrod is a great, great comfort to you!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general exclamation of surprise. It was a singular thing, and
      in no manner may it be considered complimentary to Penrod, that this
      speech of Miss Spence's should have immediately confirmed Mrs. Farry's
      doubts about her in the minds of all his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield shook his head pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid she's a goner,&rdquo; he went so far as to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the weird ideas!&rdquo; cried Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard anything like it in my life!&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Was that ALL she said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod again resumed attention to his soup. His mother looked at him
      curiously, and then, struck by a sudden thought, gathered the glances of
      the adults of the table by a significant movement of the head, and, by
      another, conveyed an admonition to drop the subject until later. Miss
      Spence was Penrod's teacher: it was better, for many reasons, not to
      discuss the subject of her queerness before him. This was Mrs. Schofield's
      thought at the time. Later she had another, and it kept her awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon, Mr. Schofield, returning at five o'clock from the
      cares of the day, found the house deserted, and sat down to read his
      evening paper in what appeared to be an uninhabited apartment known to its
      own world as the &ldquo;drawing-room.&rdquo; A sneeze, unexpected both to him and the
      owner, informed him of the presence of another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you, Penrod?&rdquo; the parent asked, looking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Penrod meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, Mr. Schofield discovered his son squatting under the piano, near
      an open window&mdash;his wistful Duke lying beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why under the piano?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the boy returned, with grave sweetness, &ldquo;I was just kind of
      sitting here&mdash;thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Mr. Schofield, rather touched, returned to the digestion of a
      murder, his back once more to the piano; and Penrod silently drew from
      beneath his jacket (where he had slipped it simultaneously with the
      sneeze) a paper-backed volume entitled: &ldquo;Slimsy, the Sioux City Squealer,
      or, 'Not Guilty, Your Honor.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this manner the reading-club continued in peace, absorbed, contented,
      the world well forgot&mdash;until a sudden, violently irritated slam-bang
      of the front door startled the members; and Mrs. Schofield burst into the
      room and threw herself into a chair, moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, mamma?&rdquo; asked her husband laying aside his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Passloe Schofield,&rdquo; returned the lady, &ldquo;I don't know what IS to be
      done with that boy; I do NOT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else could I mean?&rdquo; She sat up, exasperated, to stare at him. &ldquo;Henry
      Passloe Schofield, you've got to take this matter in your hands&mdash;it's
      beyond me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what has he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night I got to thinking,&rdquo; she began rapidly, &ldquo;about what Clara told
      us&mdash;thank Heaven she and Margaret and little Clara have gone to tea
      at Cousin Charlotte's!&mdash;but they'll be home soon&mdash;about what she
      said about Miss Spence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about Penrod's being a comfort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I kept thinking and thinking and thinking about it till I
      couldn't stand it any&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By GEORGE!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Schofield startlingly, stooping to look under the
      piano. A statement that he had suddenly remembered his son's presence
      would be lacking in accuracy, for the highly sensitized Penrod was, in
      fact, no longer present. No more was Duke, his faithful dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he returned, striding to the open window and looking out. &ldquo;Go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;it must be kept from Clara&mdash;and I'll never hold up
      my head again if John Farry ever hears of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hears of WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I just couldn't stand it, I got so curious; and I thought of course
      if Miss Spence HAD become a little unbalanced it was my duty to know it,
      as Penrod's mother and she his teacher; so I thought I would just call on
      her at her apartment after school and have a chat and see and I did and&mdash;oh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just come from there, and she told me&mdash;she told me! Oh, I've
      NEVER known anything like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT did she tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield, making a great effort, managed to assume a temporary
      appearance of calm. &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;bear this in mind:
      whatever you do to Penrod, it must be done in some place when Clara won't
      hear it. But the first thing to do is to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within view of the window from which Mr. Schofield was gazing was the
      closed door of the storeroom in the stable, and just outside this door
      Duke was performing a most engaging trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      His young master had taught Duke to &ldquo;sit up and beg&rdquo; when he wanted
      anything, and if that didn't get it, to &ldquo;speak.&rdquo; Duke was facing the
      closed door and sitting up and begging, and now he also spoke&mdash;in a
      loud, clear bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an open transom over the door, and from this descended&mdash;hurled
      by an unseen agency&mdash;a can half filled with old paint.
    </p>
    <p>
      It caught the small besieger of the door on his thoroughly surprised right
      ear, encouraged him to some remarkable acrobatics, and turned large
      portions of him a dull blue. Allowing only a moment to perplexity, and
      deciding, after a single and evidently unappetizing experiment, not to
      cleanse himself of paint, the loyal animal resumed his quaint, upright
      posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield seated himself on the window-sill, whence he could keep in
      view that pathetic picture of unrequited love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with your story, mamma,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I can find Penrod when
      we want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a few minutes later he added, &ldquo;And I think I know the place to do it
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the faithful voice of Duke was heard, pleading outside the bolted
      door.

      CHAPTER XII MISS RENNSDALE ACCEPTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!&rdquo; said Professor Bartet,
      emphasizing his instructions by a brisk collision of his palms at &ldquo;glide.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The school week was over, at last, but Penrod's troubles were not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round and round the ballroom went the seventeen struggling little couples
      of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class. Round and round went their
      reflections with them, swimming rhythmically in the polished, dark floor&mdash;white
      and blue and pink for the girls; black, with dabs of white, for the
      white-collared, white-gloved boys; and sparks and slivers of high light
      everywhere as the glistening pumps flickered along the surface like a
      school of flying fish. Every small pink face&mdash;with one exception&mdash;was
      painstaking and set for duty. It was a conscientious little
      merry-go-round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide! One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide!
      One-two-th&mdash;Ha! Mister Penrod Schofield, you lose the step. Your left
      foot! No, no! This is the left! See&mdash;like me! Now again!
      One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide! Better! Much better! Again!
      One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;gl&mdash;Stop! Mr. Penrod Schofield,
      this dancing class is provided by the kind parents of the pupilses as much
      to learn the mannerss of good societies as to dance. You think you shall
      ever see a gentleman in good societies to tickle his partner in the dance
      till she say Ouch? Never! I assure you it is not done. Again! Now then!
      Piano, please! One-two-three; one-two-three&mdash;glide! Mr. Penrod
      Schofield, your right foot&mdash;your right foot! No, no! Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merry-go-round came to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Penrod Schofield and partner&rdquo;&mdash;Professor Bartet wiped his brow&mdash;&ldquo;will
      you kindly observe me? One-two-three&mdash;glide! So! Now then&mdash;no;
      you will please keep your places, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Penrod
      Schofield, I would puttickly like your attention, this is for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pickin' on me again!&rdquo; murmured the smouldering Penrod to his small,
      unsympathetic partner. &ldquo;Can't let me alone a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Georgie Bassett, please step to the centre,&rdquo; said the professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bassett complied with modest alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teacher's pet!&rdquo; whispered Penrod hoarsely. He had nothing but contempt
      for Georgie Bassett. The parents, guardians, aunts, uncles, cousins,
      governesses, housemaids, cooks, chauffeurs and coachmen, appertaining to
      the members of the dancing class, all dwelt in the same part of town and
      shared certain communal theories; and among the most firmly established
      was that which maintained Georgie Bassett to be the Best Boy in Town.
      Contrariwise, the unfortunate Penrod, largely because of his recent
      dazzling but disastrous attempts to control forces far beyond him, had
      been given a clear title as the Worst Boy in Town. (Population, 135,000.)
      To precisely what degree his reputation was the product of his own
      energies cannot be calculated. It was Marjorie Jones who first applied the
      description, in its definite simplicity, the day after the &ldquo;pageant,&rdquo; and,
      possibly, her frequent and effusive repetitions of it, even upon wholly
      irrelevant occasions, had something to do with its prompt and quite
      perfect acceptance by the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rennsdale will please do me the fafer to be Mr. Georgie Bassett's
      partner for one moment,&rdquo; said Professor Bartet. &ldquo;Mr. Penrod Schofield will
      please give his attention. Miss Rennsdale and Mister Bassett, obliche me,
      if you please. Others please watch. Piano, please! Now then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rennsdale, aged eight&mdash;the youngest lady in the class&mdash;and
      Mr. Georgie Bassett one-two-three&mdash;glided with consummate technique
      for the better education of Penrod Schofield. It is possible that
      amber-curled, beautiful Marjorie felt that she, rather than Miss
      Rennsdale, might have been selected as the example of perfection&mdash;or
      perhaps her remark was only woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopping everybody for that boy!&rdquo; said Marjorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, across the circle from her, heard distinctly&mdash;nay, he was
      obviously intended to hear; but over a scorched heart he preserved a stoic
      front. Whereupon Marjorie whispered derisively in the ear of her partner,
      Maurice Levy, who wore a pearl pin in his tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again, please, everybody&mdash;ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo; cried Professor
      Bartet. &ldquo;Mister Penrod Schofield, if you please, pay puttickly attention!
      Piano, please! Now then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lesson proceeded. At the close of the hour Professor Bartet stepped to
      the centre of the room and clapped his hands for attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, if you please to seat yourselves quietly,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;I speak to you now about to-morrow. As you all know&mdash;Mister Penrod
      Schofield, I am not sticking up in a tree outside that window! If you do
      me the fafer to examine I am here, insides of the room. Now then! Piano,
      pl&mdash;no, I do not wish the piano! As you all know, this is the last
      lesson of the season until next October. Tomorrow is our special
      afternoon; beginning three o'clock, we dance the cotillon. But this
      afternoon comes the test of mannerss. You must see if each know how to
      make a little formal call like a grown-up people in good societies. You
      have had good, perfect instruction; let us see if we know how to perform
      like societies ladies and gentlemen twenty-six years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, when you're dismissed each lady will go to her home and prepare to
      receive a call. The gentlemen will allow the ladies time to reach their
      houses and to prepare to receive callers; then each gentleman will call
      upon a lady and beg the pleasure to engage her for a partner in the
      cotillon to-morrow. You all know the correct, proper form for these calls,
      because didn't I work teaching you last lesson till I thought I would drop
      dead? Yes! Now each gentleman, if he reach a lady's house behind
      some-other gentleman, then he must go somewhere else to a lady's house,
      and keep calling until he secures a partner; so, as there are the same
      number of both, everybody shall have a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now please all remember that if in case&mdash;Mister Penrod Schofield,
      when you make your call on a lady I beg you to please remember that
      gentlemen in good societies do not scratch the back in societies as you
      appear to attempt; so please allow the hands to rest carelessly in the
      lap. Now please all remember that if in case&mdash;Mister Penrod
      Schofield, if you please! Gentlemen in societies do not scratch the back
      by causing frictions between it and the back of your chair, either! Nobody
      else is itching here! <i>I</i> do not itch! I cannot talk if you must
      itch! In the name of Heaven, why must you always itch? What was I saying?
      Where ah! the cotillon&mdash;yes! For the cotillon it is important nobody
      shall fail to be here tomorrow; but if any one should be so very ill he
      cannot possible come he must write a very polite note of regrets in the
      form of good societies to his engaged partner to excuse himself&mdash;and
      he must give the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think anybody is going to be that sick to-morrow&mdash;no; and I
      will find out and report to parents if anybody would try it and not be.
      But it is important for the cotillon that we have an even number of so
      many couples, and if it should happen that someone comes and her partner
      has sent her a polite note that he has genuine reasons why he cannot come,
      the note must be handed at once to me, so that I arrange some other
      partner. Is all understood? Yes. The gentlemen will remember now to allow
      the ladies plenty of time to reach their houses and prepare to receive
      calls. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your polite attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was nine blocks to the house of Marjorie Jones; but Penrod did it in
      less than seven minutes from a flying start&mdash;such was his haste to
      lay himself and his hand for the cotillon at the feet of one who had so
      recently spoken unamiably of him in public. He had not yet learned that
      the only safe male rebuke to a scornful female is to stay away from her&mdash;especially
      if that is what she desires. However, he did not wish to rebuke her;
      simply and ardently he wished to dance the cotillon with her. Resentment
      was swallowed up in hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Miss Jones' feeling for him bore a striking resemblance to
      that of Simon Legree for Uncle Tom, deterred him not at all. Naturally, he
      was not wholly unconscious that when he should lay his hand for the
      cotillon at her feet it would be her inward desire to step on it; but he
      believed that if he were first in the field Marjorie would have to accept.
      These things are governed by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his fond intention to reach her house even in advance of herself,
      and with grave misgiving he beheld a large automobile at rest before the
      sainted gate. Forthwith, a sinking feeling became a portent inside him as
      little Maurice Levy emerged from the front door of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lo, Penrod!&rdquo; said Maurice airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin' in there?&rdquo; inquired Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Marjorie's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what shouldn't I be doin' in Marjorie's?&rdquo; Mr. Levy returned
      indignantly. &ldquo;I was inviting her for my partner in the cotillon&mdash;what
      you s'pose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't got any right to!&rdquo; Penrod protested hotly. &ldquo;You can't do it
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did do it yet!&rdquo; said Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't!&rdquo; insisted Penrod. &ldquo;You got to allow them time first. He said
      the ladies had to be allowed time to prepare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain't she had time to prepare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; Penrod demanded, stepping close to his rival threateningly. &ldquo;I'd
      like to know when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; echoed the other with shrill triumph. &ldquo;When? Why, in mamma's
      sixty-horse powder limousine automobile, what Marjorie came home with me
      in! I guess that's when!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An impulse in the direction of violence became visible upon the
      countenance of Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect you need some wiping down,&rdquo; he began dangerously. &ldquo;I'll give you
      sumpthing to remem&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you will!&rdquo; Maurice cried with astonishing truculence, contorting
      himself into what he may have considered a posture of defense. &ldquo;Let's see
      you try it, you&mdash;you itcher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, defiance from such a source was dumfounding. Then,
      luckily, Penrod recollected something and glanced at the automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving therein not only the alert chauffeur but the magnificent
      outlines of Mrs. Levy, his enemy's mother, he manoeuvred his lifted hand
      so that it seemed he had but meant to scratch his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I better be goin',&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;See you tomorrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maurice mounted to the lap of luxury, and Penrod strolled away with an
      assumption of careless ease which was put to a severe strain when, from
      the rear window of the car, a sudden protuberance in the nature of a
      small, dark, curly head shrieked scornfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on&mdash;you big stiff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cotillon loomed dismally before Penrod now; but it was his duty to
      secure a partner and he set about it with a dreary heart. The delay
      occasioned by his fruitless attempt on Marjorie and the altercation with
      his enemy at her gate had allowed other ladies ample time to prepare for
      callers&mdash;and to receive them. Sadly he went from house to house,
      finding that he had been preceded in one after the other. Altogether his
      hand for the cotillon was declined eleven times that afternoon on the
      legitimate ground of previous engagement. This, with Marjorie, scored off
      all except five of the seventeen possible partners; and four of the five
      were also sealed away from him, as he learned in chance encounters with
      other boys upon the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      One lady alone remained; he bowed to the inevitable and entered this lorn
      damsel's gate at twilight with an air of great discouragement. The lorn
      damsel was Miss Rennsdale, aged eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are apt to forget that there are actually times of life when too much
      youth is a handicap. Miss Rennsdale was beautiful; she danced like a
      premiere; she had every charm but age. On that account alone had she been
      allowed so much time to prepare to receive callers that it was only by the
      most manful efforts she could keep her lip from trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A decorous maid conducted the long-belated applicant to her where she sat
      upon a sofa beside a nursery governess. The decorous maid announced him
      composedly as he made his entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rennsdale suddenly burst into loud sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I just knew it would be him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The decorous maid's composure vanished at once&mdash;likewise her decorum.
      She clapped her hand over her mouth and fled, uttering sounds. The
      governess, however, set herself to comfort her heartbroken charge, and
      presently succeeded in restoring Miss Rennsdale to a semblance of that
      poise with which a lady receives callers and accepts invitations to dance
      cotillons. But she continued to sob at intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling himself at perhaps a disadvantage, Penrod made offer of his hand
      for the morrow with a little embarrassment. Following the form prescribed
      by Professor Bartet, he advanced several paces toward the stricken lady
      and bowed formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said by rote, &ldquo;you're well, and your parents also in good
      health. May I have the pleasure of dancing the cotillon as your partner
      t'-morrow afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wet eyes of Miss Rennsdale searched his countenance without pleasure,
      and a shudder wrung her small shoulders; but the governess whispered to
      her instructively, and she made a great effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thu-thank you fu-for your polite invu-invu-invutation; and I ac&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Thus far she progressed when emotion overcame her again. She beat
      frantically upon the sofa with fists and heels. &ldquo;Oh, I DID want it to be
      Georgie Bassett!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; said the governess, and whispered urgently, whereupon Miss
      Rennsdale was able to complete her acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I ac-accept wu-with pu-pleasure!&rdquo; she moaned, and immediately,
      uttering a loud yell, flung herself face downward upon the sofa, clutching
      her governess convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat disconcerted, Penrod bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your polite acceptance,&rdquo; he murmured hurriedly; &ldquo;and I
      trust&mdash;I trust&mdash;I forget. Oh, yes&mdash;I trust we shall have a
      most enjoyable occasion. Pray present my compliments to your parents; and
      I must now wish you a very good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Concluding these courtly demonstrations with another bow he withdrew in
      fair order, though thrown into partial confusion in the hall by a final
      wail from his crushed hostess:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Why couldn't it be anybody but HIM!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII THE SMALLPOX MEDICINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning Penrod woke in profound depression of spirit, the cotillon
      ominous before him. He pictured Marjorie Jones and Maurice, graceful and
      light-hearted, flitting by him fairylike, loosing silvery laughter upon
      him as he engaged in the struggle to keep step with a partner about four
      years and two feet his junior. It was hard enough for Penrod to keep step
      with a girl of his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreboding vision remained with him, increasing in vividness,
      throughout the forenoon. He found himself unable to fix his mind upon
      anything else, and, having bent his gloomy footsteps toward the
      sawdust-box, after breakfast, presently descended therefrom, abandoning
      Harold Ramorez where he had left him the preceding Saturday. Then, as he
      sat communing silently with wistful Duke, in the storeroom, coquettish
      fortune looked his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the habit of Penrod's mother not to throw away anything whatsoever
      until years of storage conclusively proved there would never be a use for
      it; but a recent house-cleaning had ejected upon the back porch a great
      quantity of bottles and other paraphernalia of medicine, left over from
      illnesses in the family during a period of several years. This debris
      Della, the cook, had collected in a large market basket, adding to it some
      bottles of flavouring extracts that had proved unpopular in the household;
      also, old catsup bottles; a jar or two of preserves gone bad; various
      rejected dental liquids&mdash;and other things. And she carried the basket
      out to the storeroom in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was at first unaware of what lay before him. Chin on palms, he sat
      upon the iron rim of a former aquarium and stared morbidly through the
      open door at the checkered departing back of Della. It was another who saw
      treasure in the basket she had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samuel Williams, aged eleven, and congenial to Penrod in years, sex,
      and disposition, appeared in the doorway, shaking into foam a black liquid
      within a pint bottle, stoppered by a thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; the visitor gave greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay,&rdquo; said Penrod with slight enthusiasm. &ldquo;What you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lickrish water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinkin's!&rdquo; demanded Penrod promptly. This is equivalent to the cry of
      &ldquo;Biters&rdquo; when an apple is shown, and establishes unquestionable title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down to there!&rdquo; stipulated Sam, removing his thumb to affix it firmly as
      a mark upon the side of the bottle a check upon gormandizing that remained
      carefully in place while Penrod drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rite concluded, the visitor's eye fell upon the basket deposited by
      Della. He emitted tokens of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky! Looky! Looky there! That ain't any good pile o' stuff&mdash;oh,
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drug store!&rdquo; shouted Sam. &ldquo;We'll be partners&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else,&rdquo; Penrod suggested, &ldquo;I'll run the drug store and you be a
      customer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Partners!&rdquo; insisted Sam with such conviction that his host yielded;
      and within ten minutes the drug store was doing a heavy business with
      imaginary patrons. Improvising counters with boards and boxes, and setting
      forth a very druggish-looking stock from the basket, each of the partners
      found occupation to his taste&mdash;Penrod as salesman and Sam as
      prescription clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, madam!&rdquo; said Penrod briskly, offering a vial of Sam's
      mixing to an invisible matron. &ldquo;This will cure your husband in a few
      minutes. Here's the camphor, mister. Call again! Fifty cents' worth of
      pills? Yes, madam. There you are! Hurry up with that dose for the nigger
      lady, Bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll 'tend to it soon's I get time, Jim,&rdquo; replied the prescription clerk.
      &ldquo;I'm busy fixin' the smallpox medicine for the sick policeman downtown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod stopped sales to watch this operation. Sam had found an empty pint
      bottle and, with the pursed lips and measuring eye of a great chemist, was
      engaged in filling it from other bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he poured into it some of the syrup from the condemned preserves;
      and a quantity of extinct hair oil; next the remaining contents of a dozen
      small vials cryptically labelled with physicians' prescriptions; then some
      remnants of catsup and essence of beef and what was left in several
      bottles of mouthwash; after that a quantity of rejected flavouring extract&mdash;topping
      off by shaking into the mouth of the bottle various powders from small
      pink papers, relics of Mr. Schofield's influenza of the preceding winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam examined the combination with concern, appearing unsatisfied. &ldquo;We got
      to make that smallpox medicine good and strong!&rdquo; he remarked; and, his
      artistic sense growing more powerful than his appetite, he poured about a
      quarter of the licorice water into the smallpox medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin'?&rdquo; protested Penrod. &ldquo;What you want to waste that lickrish
      water for? We ought to keep it to drink when we're tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I got a right to use my own lickrish water any way I want to,&rdquo;
       replied the prescription clerk. &ldquo;I tell you, you can't get smallpox
      medicine too strong. Look at her now!&rdquo; He held the bottle up admiringly.
      &ldquo;She's as black as lickrish. I bet you she's strong all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how she tastes?&rdquo; said Penrod thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't smell so awful much,&rdquo; observed Sam, sniffing the bottle&mdash;&ldquo;a
      good deal, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it'd make us sick to drink it?&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam looked at the bottle thoughtfully; then his eye, wandering, fell upon
      Duke, placidly curled up near the door, and lighted with the advent of an
      idea new to him, but old, old in the world&mdash;older than Egypt!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's give Duke some!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the spark. They acted immediately; and a minute later Duke,
      released from custody with a competent potion of the smallpox medicine
      inside him, settled conclusively their doubts concerning its effect. The
      patient animal, accustomed to expect the worst at all times, walked out of
      the door, shaking his head with an air of considerable annoyance, opening
      and closing his mouth with singular energy&mdash;and so repeatedly that
      they began to count the number of times he did it. Sam thought it was
      thirty-nine times, but Penrod had counted forty-one before other and more
      striking symptoms appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      All things come from Mother Earth and must return&mdash;Duke restored much
      at this time. Afterward, he ate heartily of grass; and then, over his
      shoulder, he bent upon his master one inscrutable look and departed feebly
      to the front yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys had watched the process with warm interest. &ldquo;I told you she
      was strong!&rdquo; said Mr. Williams proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;she is!&rdquo; Penrod was generous enough to admit. &ldquo;I expect
      she's strong enough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused in thought, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't got a horse any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you she'd fix him if you had!&rdquo; said Sam. And it may be that this
      was no idle boast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pharmaceutical game was not resumed; the experiment upon Duke had made
      the drug store commonplace and stimulated the appetite for stronger meat.
      Lounging in the doorway, the near-vivisectionists sipped licorice water
      alternately and conversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet some of our smallpox medicine would fix ole P'fessor Bartet all
      right!&rdquo; quoth Penrod. &ldquo;I wish he'd come along and ask us for some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could tell him it was lickrish water,&rdquo; added Sam, liking the idea.
      &ldquo;The two bottles look almost the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we wouldn't have to go to his ole cotillon this afternoon,&rdquo; Penrod
      sighed. &ldquo;There wouldn't be any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's your partner, Pen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's yours? I just ast you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's all right!&rdquo; And Penrod smiled boastfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you wanted to dance with Marjorie!&rdquo; said his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I wouldn't dance with that girl if she begged me to! I wouldn't dance
      with her to save her from drowning! I wouldn't da&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;you wouldn't!&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Williams skeptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod changed his tone and became persuasive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here, Sam,&rdquo; he said confidentially. &ldquo;I've got 'a mighty nice
      partner, but my mother don't like her mother; and so I've been thinking I
      better not dance with her. I'll tell you what I'll do; I've got a mighty
      good sling in the house, and I'll give it to you if you'll change
      partners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to change and you don't even know who mine is!&rdquo; said Sam, and he
      made the simple though precocious deduction: &ldquo;Yours must be a lala! Well,
      I invited Mabel Rorebeck, and she wouldn't let me change if I wanted to.
      Mabel Rorebeck'd rather dance with me,&rdquo; he continued serenely, &ldquo;than
      anybody; and she said she was awful afraid you'd ast her. But I ain't
      goin' to dance with Mabel after all, because this morning she sent me a
      note about her uncle died last night&mdash;and P'fessor Bartet'll have to
      find me a partner after I get there. Anyway I bet you haven't got any
      sling&mdash;and I bet your partner's Baby Rennsdale!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if she is?&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;She's good enough for ME!&rdquo; This speech
      held not so much modesty in solution as intended praise of the lady. Taken
      literally, however, it was an understatement of the facts and wholly
      insincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; jeered Mr. Williams, upon whom his friend's hypocrisy was quite
      wasted. &ldquo;How can your mother not like her mother? Baby Rennsdale hasn't
      got any mother! You and her'll be a sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Penrod's own conviction; and with this corroboration of it he
      grew so spiritless that he could offer no retort. He slid to a despondent
      sitting posture upon the door sill and gazed wretchedly upon the ground,
      while his companion went to replenish the licorice water at the hydrant&mdash;enfeebling
      the potency of the liquor no doubt, but making up for that in quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother goin' with you to the cotillon?&rdquo; asked Sam when he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She's goin' to meet me there. She's goin' somewhere first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So's mine,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I'll come by for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I better go before long. Noon whistles been blowin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Penrod repeated dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam turned to go, but paused. A new straw hat was peregrinating along the
      fence near the two boys. This hat belonged to someone passing upon the
      sidewalk of the cross-street; and the someone was Maurice Levy. Even as
      they stared, he halted and regarded them over the fence with two small,
      dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate had brought about this moment and this confrontation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV MAURICE LEVY'S CONSTITUTION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Lo, Sam!&rdquo; said Maurice cautiously. &ldquo;What you doin'?&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Penrod at that instant had a singular experience&mdash;an intellectual
      shock like a flash of fire in the brain. Sitting in darkness, a great
      light flooded him with wild brilliance. He gasped!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin'?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod sprang to his feet, seized the licorice bottle, shook it with
      stoppering thumb, and took a long drink with histrionic unction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin'?&rdquo; asked Maurice for the third time, Sam Williams not
      having decided upon a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Penrod who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinkin' lickrish water,&rdquo; he said simply, and wiped his mouth with such
      delicious enjoyment that Sam's jaded thirst was instantly stimulated. He
      took the bottle eagerly from Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-a-h!&rdquo; exclaimed Penrod, smacking his lips. &ldquo;That was a good un!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes above the fence glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him if he don't want some,&rdquo; Penrod whispered urgently. &ldquo;Quit drinkin'
      it! It's no good any more. Ask him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the practical Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on and ask him!&rdquo; whispered Penrod fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, M'rice!&rdquo; Sam called, waving the bottle. &ldquo;Want some?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring it here!&rdquo; Mr. Levy requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on over and get some,&rdquo; returned Sam, being prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't. Penrod Schofield's after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not,&rdquo; said Penrod reassuringly. &ldquo;I won't touch you, M'rice. I
      made up with you yesterday afternoon&mdash;don't you remember? You're all
      right with me, M'rice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maurice looked undecided. But Penrod had the delectable bottle again, and
      tilting it above his lips, affected to let the cool liquid purl
      enrichingly into him, while with his right hand he stroked his middle
      facade ineffably. Maurice's mouth watered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; cried Sam, stirred again by the superb manifestations of his
      friend. &ldquo;Gimme that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod brought the bottle down, surprisingly full after so much gusto, but
      withheld it from Sam; and the two scuffled for its possession. Nothing in
      the world could have so worked upon the desire of the yearning observer
      beyond the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, Penrod&mdash;you ain't goin' to touch me if I come in your yard?&rdquo;
       he called. &ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cross my heart!&rdquo; answered Penrod, holding the bottle away from Sam. &ldquo;And
      we'll let you drink all you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maurice hastily climbed the fence, and while he was thus occupied Mr.
      Samuel Williams received a great enlightenment. With startling rapidity
      Penrod, standing just outside the storeroom door, extended his arm within
      the room, deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the drug store,
      seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine, and extended it
      cordially toward the advancing Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genius is like that&mdash;great, simple, broad strokes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzled, Mr. Samuel Williams leaned against the wall. He had the
      sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a chef-d'oeuvre.
      Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost universal one on such
      huge occasions: &ldquo;Why couldn't <i>I</i> have done that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not
      altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of
      the new Talleyrand. Sam had no partner for the cotillon. If Maurice was to
      be absent from that festivity&mdash;as it began to seem he might be&mdash;Penrod
      needed a male friend to take care of Miss Rennsdale and he believed he saw
      his way to compel Mr. Williams to be that male friend. For this he relied
      largely upon the prospective conduct of Miss Rennsdale when he should get
      the matter before her&mdash;he was inclined to believe she would favour
      the exchange. As for Talleyrand Penrod himself, he was going to dance that
      cotillon with Marjorie Jones!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have all you can drink at one pull, M'rice,&rdquo; said Penrod kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said I could have all I want!&rdquo; protested Maurice, reaching for the
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't,&rdquo; returned Penrod quickly, holding it away from the eager
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, too! Didn't he, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam could not reply; his eyes, fixed upon the bottle, protruded strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard him&mdash;didn't you, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I did say it I didn't mean it!&rdquo; said Penrod hastily, quoting
      from one of the authorities. &ldquo;Looky here, M'rice,&rdquo; he continued, assuming
      a more placative and reasoning tone, &ldquo;that wouldn't be fair to us. I guess
      we want some of our own lickrish water, don't we? The bottle ain't much
      over two-thirds full anyway. What I meant was, you can have all you can
      drink at one pull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this way: you can gulp all you want, so long as you keep swallering;
      but you can't take the bottle out of your mouth and commence again. Soon's
      you quit swallering it's Sam's turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you can have next, Penrod,&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway, I mean M'rice has to give the bottle up the minute he stops
      swallering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craft appeared upon the face of Maurice, like a poster pasted on a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can drink so long I don't stop swallering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Gimme the bottle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Penrod placed it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise to let me drink until I quit swallering?&rdquo; Maurice insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said both boys together.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, Maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to drink.
      Penrod and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement. They had feared
      Maurice might smell the contents of the bottle; but that danger was past&mdash;this
      was the crucial moment. Their fondest hope was that he would make his
      first swallow a voracious one&mdash;it was impossible to imagine a second.
      They expected one big, gulping swallow and then an explosion, with
      fountain effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little they knew the mettle of their man! Maurice swallowed once; he
      swallowed twice&mdash;and thrice&mdash;and he continued to swallow! No
      Adam's apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat, but the internal
      progress of the liquid was not a whit the less visible. His eyes gleamed
      with cunning and malicious triumph, sidewise, at the stunned conspirators;
      he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught, not once breaking the
      thread of that marvelous swallering.
    </p>
    <p>
      His audience stood petrified. Already Maurice had swallowed more than they
      had given Duke and still the liquor receded in the uplifted bottle! And
      now the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents full half the vessel's
      length&mdash;and Maurice went on drinking! Slowly the clear glass
      increased in its dimensions&mdash;slowly the dark diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check him&mdash;but Maurice
      protested passionately with his disengaged arm, and made vehement vocal
      noises remindful of the contract; whereupon Sam desisted and watched the
      continuing performance in a state of grisly fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice drank it all! He drained the last drop and threw the bottle in the
      air, uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; he cried, blowing out his cheeks, inflating his chest, squaring his
      shoulders, patting his stomach, and wiping his mouth contentedly. &ldquo;Hah!
      Aha! Waha! Wafwah! But that was good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two boys stood looking at him in stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I gotta say this,&rdquo; said Maurice graciously: &ldquo;You stuck to your
      bargain all right and treated me fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion, Penrod entered the storeroom in
      one stride and lifted the bottle of licorice water to his nose&mdash;then
      to his lips. It was weak, but good; he had made no mistake. And Maurice
      had really drained&mdash;to the dregs&mdash;the bottle of old hair tonics,
      dead catsups, syrups of undesirable preserves, condemned extracts of
      vanilla and lemon, decayed chocolate, ex-essence of beef, mixed dental
      preparations, aromatic spirits of ammonia, spirits of nitre, alcohol,
      arnica, quinine, ipecac, sal volatile, nux vomica and licorice water&mdash;
      with traces of arsenic, belladonna and strychnine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod put the licorice water out of sight and turned to face the others.
      Maurice was seating himself on a box just outside the door and had taken a
      package of cigarettes from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can see me from here, can they?&rdquo; he said, striking a match. &ldquo;You
      fellers smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam, staring at him haggardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Penrod in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you fellers are certainly square&mdash;I gotta
      say that much. Honest, Penrod, I thought you was after me! I did think
      so,&rdquo; he added sunnily; &ldquo;but now I guess you like me, or else you wouldn't
      of stuck to it about lettin' me drink it all if I kept on swallering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chatted on with complete geniality, smoking his cigarette in content.
      And as he ran from one topic to another his hearers stared at him in a
      kind of torpor. Never once did they exchange a glance with each other;
      their eyes were frozen to Maurice. The cheerful conversationalist made it
      evident that he was not without gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said as he finished his cigarette and rose to go, &ldquo;you fellers
      have treated me nice and some day you come over to my yard; I'd like to
      run with you fellers. You're the kind of fellers I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's jaw fell; Sam's mouth had been open all the time. Neither spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gotta go,&rdquo; observed Maurice, consulting a handsome watch. &ldquo;Gotta get
      dressed for the cotillon right after lunch. Come on, Sam. Don't you have
      to go, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam nodded dazedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye, Penrod,&rdquo; said Maurice cordially. &ldquo;I'm glad you like me
      all right. Come on, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod leaned against the doorpost and with fixed and glazing eyes watched
      the departure of his two visitors. Maurice was talking volubly, with much
      gesticulation, as they went; but Sam walked mechanically and in silence,
      staring at his brisk companion and keeping at a little distance from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed from sight, Maurice still conversing gayly&mdash;and Penrod
      slowly betook himself into the house, his head bowed upon his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some three hours later, Mr. Samuel Williams, waxen clean and in sweet
      raiment, made his reappearance in Penrod's yard, yodelling a code-signal
      to summon forth his friend. He yodelled loud, long, and frequently,
      finally securing a faint response from the upper air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; shouted Mr. Williams, his roving glance searching ambient
      heights. Another low-spirited yodel reaching his ear, he perceived the
      head and shoulders of his friend projecting above the roofridge of the
      stable. The rest of Penrod's body was concealed from view, reposing upon
      the opposite slant of the gable and precariously secured by the crooking
      of his elbows over the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! What you doin' up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better be careful!&rdquo; Sam called. &ldquo;You'll slide off and fall down in
      the alley if you don't look out. I come pert' near it last time we was up
      there. Come on down! Ain't you goin' to the cotillon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod made no reply. Sam came nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he called up in a guarded voice, &ldquo;I went to our telephone a while
      ago and ast him how he was feelin', and he said he felt fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;He told me he felt bully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam thrust his hands in his pockets and brooded. The opening of the
      kitchen door caused a diversion. It was Della.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mister Penrod,&rdquo; she bellowed forthwith, &ldquo;come ahn down fr'm up there! Y'r
      mamma's at the dancin' class waitin' fer ye, an' she's telephoned me
      they're goin' to begin&mdash;an' what's the matter with ye? Come ahn down
      fr'm up there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; urged Sam. &ldquo;We'll be late. There go Maurice and Marjorie now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glittering car spun by, disclosing briefly a genre picture of Marjorie
      Jones in pink, supporting a monstrous sheaf of American Beauty roses.
      Maurice, sitting shining and joyous beside her, saw both boys and waved
      them a hearty greeting as the car turned the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both arms&mdash;either in
      response or as an expression of his condition of mind; it may have been a
      gesture of despair. How much intention there was in this act&mdash;obviously
      so rash, considering the position he occupied&mdash;it is impossible to
      say. Undeniably there must remain a suspicion of deliberate purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Della screamed and Sam shouted. Penrod had disappeared from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delayed dance was about to begin a most uneven cotillon when Samuel
      Williams arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom; while Miss Rennsdale, flushing
      with sudden happiness, curtsied profoundly to Professor Bartet and
      obtained his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have telled you fifty times,&rdquo; he informed her passionately ere she
      spoke, &ldquo;I cannot make no such changes. If your partner comes you have to
      dance with him. You are going to drive me crazy, sure! What is it? What
      now? What you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The damsel curtsied again and handed him the following communication,
      addressed to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam Please excuse me from dancing the cotilon with you this
      afternoon as I have fell off the barn
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sincerly yours
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV THE TWO FAMILIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Penrod entered the schoolroom, Monday picturesquely leaning upon a man's
      cane shortened to support a cripple approaching the age of twelve. He
      arrived about twenty minutes late, limping deeply, his brave young mouth
      drawn with pain, and the sensation he created must have been a solace to
      him; the only possible criticism of this entrance being that it was just a
      shade too heroic. Perhaps for that reason it failed to stagger Miss
      Spence, a woman so saturated with suspicion that she penalized Penrod for
      tardiness as promptly and as coldly as if he had been a mere, ordinary,
      unmutilated boy. Nor would she entertain any discussion of the justice of
      her ruling. It seemed, almost, that she feared to argue with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the distinction of cane and limp remained to him, consolations
      which he protracted far into the week&mdash;until Thursday evening, in
      fact, when Mr. Schofield, observing from a window his son's pursuit of
      Duke round and round the backyard, confiscated the cane, with the promise
      that it should not remain idle if he saw Penrod limping again. Thus,
      succeeding a depressing Friday, another Saturday brought the necessity for
      new inventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a scented morning in apple-blossom time. At about ten of the clock
      Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door. His pockets bulged
      abnormally; so did his checks, and he swallowed with difficulty. A
      threatening mop, wielded by a cooklike arm in a checkered sleeve, followed
      him through the doorway, and he was preceded by a small, hurried, wistful
      dog with a warm doughnut in his mouth. The kitchen door slammed
      petulantly, enclosing the sore voice of Della, whereupon Penrod and Duke
      seated themselves upon the pleasant sward and immediately consumed the
      spoils of their raid.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the cross-street which formed the side boundary of the Schofields'
      ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced clatter of a pair of
      trotting horses, and Penrod, looking up, beheld the passing of a fat
      acquaintance, torpid amid the conservative splendours of a rather
      old-fashioned victoria. This was Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, a
      fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class, but otherwise not
      often a companion: a home-sheltered lad, tutored privately and preserved
      against the coarsening influences of rude comradeship and miscellaneous
      information. Heavily overgrown in all physical dimensions, virtuous, and
      placid, this cloistered mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod
      Schofield. Nevertheless, Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, was a personage
      on account of the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family; and it was
      Penrod's destiny to increase Roderick's celebrity far, far beyond its
      present aristocratic limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive; there
      was no other reason. And they were impressive because they believed
      themselves important. The adults of the family were impregnably formal;
      they dressed with reticent elegance, and wore the same nose and the same
      expression&mdash;an expression which indicated that they knew something
      exquisite and sacred which other people could never know. Other people, in
      their presence, were apt to feel mysteriously ignoble and to become
      secretly uneasy about ancestors, gloves, and pronunciation. The Magsworth
      Bitts manner was withholding and reserved, though sometimes gracious,
      granting small smiles as great favours and giving off a chilling kind of
      preciousness. Naturally, when any citizen of the community did anything
      unconventional or improper, or made a mistake, or had a relative who went
      wrong, that citizen's first and worst fear was that the Magsworth Bittses
      would hear of it. In fact, this painful family had for years terrorized
      the community, though the community had never realized that it was
      terrorized, and invariably spoke of the family as the &ldquo;most charming
      circle in town.&rdquo; By common consent, Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts
      officiated as the supreme model as well as critic-in-chief of morals and
      deportment for all the unlucky people prosperous enough to be elevated to
      her acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magsworth was the important part of the name. Mrs. Roderick Magsworth
      Bitts was a Magsworth born, herself, and the Magsworth crest decorated not
      only Mrs. Magsworth Bitts' note-paper but was on the china, on the table
      linen, on the chimney-pieces, on the opaque glass of the front door, on
      the victoria, and on the harness, though omitted from the garden-hose and
      the lawn-mower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious crest
      with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose name had grown
      week by week into larger and larger type upon the front pages of
      newspapers, owing to the gradually increasing public and official belief
      that she had poisoned a family of eight. However, the statement that no
      sensible person could have connected the Magsworth Bitts family with the
      arsenical Rena takes no account of Penrod Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod never missed a murder, a hanging or an electrocution in the
      newspapers; he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as her jurymen
      did, though they sat in a court-room two hundred miles away, and he had it
      in mind&mdash;so frank he was&mdash;to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts,
      Junior, if the murderess happened to be a relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present encounter, being merely one of apathetic greeting, did not
      afford the opportunity. Penrod took off his cap, and Roderick, seated
      between his mother and one of his grown-up sisters, nodded sluggishly, but
      neither Mrs. Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter acknowledged the salutation
      of the boy in the yard. They disapproved of him as a person of little
      consequence, and that little, bad. Snubbed, Penrod thoughtfully restored
      his cap to his head. A boy can be cut as effectually as a man, and this
      one was chilled to a low temperature. He wondered if they despised him
      because they had seen a last fragment of doughnut in his hand; then he
      thought that perhaps it was Duke who had disgraced him. Duke was certainly
      no fashionable looking dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resilient spirits of youth, however, presently revived, and
      discovering a spider upon one knee and a beetle simultaneously upon the
      other, Penrod forgot Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts in the course of some
      experiments infringing upon the domain of Doctor Carrel. Penrod's efforts&mdash;with
      the aid of a pin&mdash;to effect a transference of living organism were
      unsuccessful; but he convinced himself forever that a spider cannot walk
      with a beetle's legs. Della then enhanced zoological interest by
      depositing upon the back porch a large rat-trap from the cellar, the
      prison of four live rats awaiting execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod at once took possession, retiring to the empty stable, where he
      installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet of broken
      window-glass&mdash;held down by a brickbat&mdash;over the top. Thus the
      symptoms of their agitation, when the box was shaken or hammered upon,
      could be studied at leisure. Altogether this Saturday was starting
      splendidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, the student's attention was withdrawn from his specimens by
      a peculiar smell, which, being followed up by a system of selective
      sniffing, proved to be an emanation leaking into the stable from the
      alley. He opened the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had built on the
      rear line of his lot and rented to negroes; and the fact that a negro
      family was now in process of &ldquo;moving in&rdquo; was manifested by the presence of
      a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon, the latter laden with the semblance of
      a stove and a few other unpretentious household articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very small darky boy stood near the mule. In his hand was a rusty chain,
      and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod perceived the source of
      the special smell he was tracing&mdash;a large raccoon. Duke, who had
      shown not the slightest interest in the rats, set up a frantic barking and
      simulated a ravening assault upon the strange animal. It was only a bit of
      acting, however, for Duke was an old dog, had suffered much, and desired
      no unnecessary sorrow, wherefore he confined his demonstrations to alarums
      and excursions, and presently sat down at a distance and expressed himself
      by intermittent threatenings in a quavering falsetto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that 'coon's name?&rdquo; asked Penrod, intending no discourtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim gommo mame,&rdquo; said the small darky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim gommo mame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small darky looked annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aim GOMMO mame, I hell you,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod conceived that insult was intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter of you?&rdquo; he demanded advancing. &ldquo;You get fresh with ME,
      and I'll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyuh, white boy!&rdquo; A coloured youth of Penrod's own age appeared in the
      doorway of the cottage. &ldquo;You let 'at brothuh mine alone. He ain' do
      nothin' to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why can't he answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't. He can't talk no better'n what he WAS talkin'. He tongue-tie'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Penrod, mollified. Then, obeying an impulse so universally
      aroused in the human breast under like circumstances that it has become a
      quip, he turned to the afflicted one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk some more,&rdquo; he begged eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoe you ackoom aim gommo mame,&rdquo; was the prompt response, in which a
      slight ostentation was manifest. Unmistakable tokens of vanity had
      appeared upon the small, swart countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he mean?&rdquo; asked Penrod, enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He say he tole you 'at 'coon ain' got no name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's YOUR name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm name Herman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his name?&rdquo; Penrod pointed to the tongue-tied boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verman. Was three us boys in ow fam'ly. Ol'est one name Sherman. 'N'en
      come me; I'm Herman. 'N'en come him; he Verman. Sherman dead. Verman, he
      de littles' one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You goin' to live here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umhuh. Done move in f'm way outen on a fahm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the north with his right hand, and Penrod's eyes opened wide
      as they followed the gesture. Herman had no forefinger on that hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; exclaimed Penrod. &ldquo;You haven't got any finger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> mum map,&rdquo; said Verman, with egregious pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE done 'at,&rdquo; interpreted Herman, chuckling. &ldquo;Yessuh; done chop 'er spang
      off, long 'go. He's a playin' wif a ax an' I lay my finguh on de do'-sill
      an' I say, 'Verman, chop 'er off!' So Verman he chop 'er right spang off
      up to de roots! Yessuh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What FOR?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes' fo' nothin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hoe me hoo,&rdquo; remarked Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessuh, I tole him to,&rdquo; said Herman, &ldquo;an' he chop 'er off, an' ey ain't
      airy oth' one evuh grown on wheres de ole one use to grow. Nosuh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what'd you tell him to do it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I 'es' said it 'at way&mdash;an' he jes' chop er off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both brothers looked pleased and proud. Penrod's profound interest was
      flatteringly visible, a tribute to their unusualness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem bow goy,&rdquo; suggested Verman eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw ri',&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;Ow sistuh Queenie, she a growed-up woman; she got
      a goituh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goituh. Swellin' on her neck&mdash;grea' big swellin'. She heppin' mammy
      move in now. You look in de front-room winduh wheres she sweepin'; you kin
      see it on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked in the window and was rewarded by a fine view of Queenie's
      goitre. He had never before seen one, and only the lure of further
      conversation on the part of Verman brought him from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verman say tell you 'bout pappy,&rdquo; explained Herman. &ldquo;Mammy an' Queenie
      move in town an' go git de house all fix up befo' pappy git out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jail. Pappy cut a man, an' de police done kep' him in jail evuh sense
      Chris'mus-time; but dey goin' tuhn him loose ag'in nex' week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd he cut the other man with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wif a pitchfawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod began to feel that a lifetime spent with this fascinating family
      were all too short. The brothers, glowing with amiability, were as
      enraptured as he. For the first time in their lives they moved in the rich
      glamour of sensationalism. Herman was prodigal of gesture with his right
      hand; and Verman, chuckling with delight, talked fluently, though somewhat
      consciously. They cheerfully agreed to keep the raccoon&mdash;already
      beginning to be mentioned as &ldquo;our 'coon&rdquo; by Penrod&mdash;in Mr.
      Schofield's empty stable, and, when the animal had been chained to the
      wall near the box of rats and supplied with a pan of fair water, they
      assented to their new friend's suggestion (inspired by a fine sense of the
      artistic harmonies) that the heretofore nameless pet be christened
      Sherman, in honour of their deceased relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture was heard from the front yard the sound of that yodelling
      which is the peculiar accomplishment of those whose voices have not
      &ldquo;changed.&rdquo; Penrod yodelled a response; and Mr. Samuel Williams appeared, a
      large bundle under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; was his greeting, casual enough from without; but, having
      entered, he stopped short and emitted a prodigious whistle. &ldquo;YA-A-AY!&rdquo; he
      then shouted. &ldquo;Look at the 'coon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you better say, 'Look at the 'coon!'&rdquo; Penrod returned proudly.
      &ldquo;They's a good deal more'n him to look at, too. Talk some, Verman.&rdquo; Verman
      complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was warmly interested. &ldquo;What'd you say his name was?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you spell it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;V-e-r-m-a-n,&rdquo; replied Penrod, having previously received this information
      from Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Point to sumpthing, Herman,&rdquo; Penrod commanded, and Sam's excitement, when
      Herman pointed was sufficient to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, the discoverer, continued his exploitation of the manifold wonders
      of the Sherman, Herman, and Verman collection. With the air of a
      proprietor he escorted Sam into the alley for a good look at Queenie (who
      seemed not to care for her increasing celebrity) and proceeded to a
      dramatic climax&mdash;the recital of the episode of the pitchfork and its
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cumulative effect was enormous, and could have but one possible
      result. The normal boy is always at least one half Barnum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's get up a SHOW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod and Sam both claimed to have said it first, a question left
      unsettled in the ecstasies of hurried preparation. The bundle under Sam's
      arm, brought with no definite purpose, proved to have been an inspiration.
      It consisted of broad sheets of light yellow wrapping-paper, discarded by
      Sam's mother in her spring house-cleaning. There were half-filled cans and
      buckets of paint in the storeroom adjoining the carriage-house, and
      presently the side wall of the stable flamed information upon the
      passer-by from a great and spreading poster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Publicity,&rdquo; primal requisite of all theatrical and amphitheatrical
      enterprise thus provided, subsequent arrangements proceeded with a fury of
      energy which transformed the empty hayloft. True, it is impossible to say
      just what the hay-loft was transformed into, but history warrantably
      clings to the statement that it was transformed. Duke and Sherman were
      secured to the rear wall at a considerable distance from each other, after
      an exhibition of reluctance on the part of Duke, during which he displayed
      a nervous energy and agility almost miraculous in so small and middle-aged
      a dog. Benches were improvised for spectators; the rats were brought up;
      finally the rafters, corn-crib, and hay-chute were ornamented with flags
      and strips of bunting from Sam Williams' attic, Sam returning from the
      excursion wearing an old silk hat, and accompanied (on account of a rope)
      by a fine dachshund encountered on the highway. In the matter of personal
      decoration paint was generously used: an interpretation of the spiral,
      inclining to whites and greens, becoming brilliantly effective upon the
      dark facial backgrounds of Herman and Verman; while the countenances of
      Sam and Penrod were each supplied with the black moustache and imperial,
      lacking which, no professional showman can be esteemed conscientious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was regretfully decided, in council, that no attempt be made to add
      Queenie to the list of exhibits, her brothers warmly declining to act as
      ambassadors in that cause. They were certain Queenie would not like the
      idea, they said, and Herman picturesquely described her activity on
      occasions when she had been annoyed by too much attention to her
      appearance. However, Penrod's disappointment was alleviated by an
      inspiration which came to him in a moment of pondering upon the dachshund,
      and the entire party went forth to add an enriching line to the poster.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a group of seven, including two adults, already gathered in the
      street to read and admire this work.

    <p>
      A heated argument took place between Sam and Penrod, the point at issue
      being settled, finally, by the drawing of straws; whereupon Penrod, with
      pardonable self-importance&mdash;in the presence of an audience now
      increased to nine&mdash;slowly painted the words inspired by the
      dachshund:

      CHAPTER XVI THE NEW STAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sam, Penrod, Herman, and Verman withdrew in considerable state from
      non-paying view, and, repairing to the hay-loft, declared the exhibition
      open to the public. Oral proclamation was made by Sam, and then the
      loitering multitude was enticed by the seductive strains of a band; the
      two partners performing upon combs and paper, Herman and Verman upon tin
      pans with sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was immediate. Visitors appeared upon the stairway and sought
      admission. Herman and Verman took position among the exhibits, near the
      wall; Sam stood at the entrance, officiating as barker and ticket-seller;
      while Penrod, with debonair suavity, acted as curator, master of
      ceremonies, and lecturer. He greeted the first to enter with a courtly
      bow. They consisted of Miss Rennsdale and her nursery governess, and they
      paid spot cash for their admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk in, lay-deeze, walk right in&mdash;pray do not obstruck the
      passageway,&rdquo; said Penrod, in a remarkable voice. &ldquo;Pray be seated; there is
      room for each and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rennsdale and governess were followed by Mr. Georgie Bassett and baby
      sister (which proves the perfection of Georgie's character) and six or
      seven other neighbourhood children&mdash;a most satisfactory audience,
      although, subsequent to Miss Rennsdale and governess, admission was wholly
      by pin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze,&rdquo; shouted Penrod, &ldquo;I will first call your
      at-tain-shon to our genuine South American dog, part alligator!&rdquo; He
      pointed to the dachshund, and added, in his ordinary tone, &ldquo;That's him.&rdquo;
       Straightway reassuming the character of showman, he bellowed: &ldquo;NEXT, you
      see Duke, the genuine, full-blooded Indian dog from the far Western Plains
      and Rocky Mountains. NEXT, the trained Michigan rats, captured way up
      there, and trained to jump and run all around the box at the&mdash;at the&mdash;at
      the slightest PRE-text!&rdquo; He paused, partly to take breath and partly to
      enjoy his own surprised discovery that this phrase was in his vocabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the slightest PRE-text!&rdquo; he repeated, and continued, suiting the
      action to the word: &ldquo;I will now hammer upon the box and each and all may
      see these genuine full-blooded Michigan rats perform at the slightest
      PRE-text! There! (That's all they do now, but I and Sam are goin' to train
      'em lots more before this afternoon.) GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze I will
      kindly now call your at-tain-shon to Sherman, the wild animal from Africa,
      costing the lives of the wild trapper and many of his companions. NEXT,
      let me kindly interodoos Herman and Verman. Their father got mad and stuck
      his pitchfork right inside of another man, exactly as promised upon the
      advertisements outside the big tent, and got put in jail. Look at them
      well, gen-til-mun and lay-deeze, there is no extra charge, and RE-MEM-BUR
      you are each and all now looking at two wild, tattooed men which the
      father of is in jail. Point, Herman. Each and all will have a chance to
      see. Point to sumpthing else, Herman. This is the only genuine
      one-fingered tattooed wild man. Last on the programme, gen-til-mun and
      lay-deeze, we have Verman, the savage tattooed wild boy, that can't speak
      only his native foreign languages. Talk some, Verman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman obliged and made an instantaneous hit. He was encored rapturously,
      again and again; and, thrilling with the unique pleasure of being
      appreciated and misunderstood at the same time, would have talked all day
      but too gladly. Sam Williams, however, with a true showman's foresight,
      whispered to Penrod, who rang down on the monologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GEN-til-mun and LAY-deeze, this closes our pufformance. Pray pass out
      quietly and with as little jostling as possible. As soon as you are all
      out there's goin' to be a new pufformance, and each and all are welcome at
      the same and simple price of admission. Pray pass out quietly and with as
      little jostling as possible. RE-MEM-BUR the price is only one cent, the
      tenth part of a dime, or twenty pins, no bent ones taken. Pray pass out
      quietly and with as little jostling as possible. The Schofield and
      Williams Military Band will play before each pufformance, and each and all
      are welcome for the same and simple price of admission. Pray pass out
      quietly and with as little jostling as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith, the Schofield and Williams Military Band began a second
      overture, in which something vaguely like a tune was at times
      distinguishable; and all of the first audience returned, most of them
      having occupied the interval in hasty excursions for more pins; Miss
      Rennsdale and governess, however, again paying coin of the Republic and
      receiving deference and the best seats accordingly. And when a third
      performance found all of the same inveterate patrons once more crowding
      the auditorium, and seven recruits added, the pleasurable excitement of
      the partners in their venture will be understood by any one who has seen a
      metropolitan manager strolling about the foyer of his theatre some evening
      during the earlier stages of an assured &ldquo;phenomenal run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the first, there was no question which feature of the entertainment
      was the attraction extraordinary: Verman&mdash;Verman, the savage tattooed
      wild boy, speaking only his native foreign languages&mdash;Verman was a
      triumph! Beaming, wreathed in smiles, melodious, incredibly fluent, he had
      but to open his lips and a dead hush fell upon the audience. Breathless,
      they leaned forward, hanging upon his every semi-syllable, and, when
      Penrod checked the flow, burst into thunders of applause, which Verman
      received with happy laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! he delayed not o'er long to display all the egregiousness of a new
      star; but for a time there was no caprice of his too eccentric to be
      forgiven. During Penrod's lecture upon the other curios, the tattooed wild
      boy continually stamped his foot, grinned, and gesticulated, tapping his
      tiny chest, and pointing to himself as it were to say: &ldquo;Wait for Me! I am
      the Big Show.&rdquo; So soon they learn; so soon they learn! And (again alas!)
      this spoiled darling of public favour, like many another, was fated to
      know, in good time, the fickleness of that favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during all the morning performances he was the idol of his audience
      and looked it! The climax of his popularity came during the fifth overture
      of the Schofield and Williams Military Band, when the music was quite
      drowned in the agitated clamours of Miss Rennsdale, who was endeavouring
      to ascend the stairs in spite of the physical dissuasion of her governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WON'T go home to lunch!&rdquo; screamed Miss Rennsdale, her voice accompanied
      by a sound of ripping. &ldquo;I WILL hear the tattooed wild boy talk some more!
      It's lovely&mdash;I WILL hear him talk! I WILL! I WILL! I want to listen
      to Verman&mdash;I WANT to&mdash;I WANT to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wailing, she was borne away&mdash;of her sex not the first to be
      fascinated by obscurity, nor the last to champion its eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman was almost unendurable after this, but, like many, many other
      managers, Schofield and Williams restrained their choler, and even laughed
      fulsomely when their principal attraction essayed the role of a comedian
      in private, and capered and squawked in sheer, fatuous vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first performance of the afternoon rivalled the successes of the
      morning, and although Miss Rennsdale was detained at home, thus drying up
      the single source of cash income developed before lunch, Maurice Levy
      appeared, escorting Marjorie Jones, and paid coin for two admissions,
      dropping the money into Sam's hand with a careless&mdash;nay, a
      contemptuous&mdash;gesture. At sight of Marjorie, Penrod Schofield flushed
      under his new moustache (repainted since noon) and lectured as he had
      never lectured before. A new grace invested his every gesture; a new
      sonorousness rang in his voice; a simple and manly pomposity marked his
      very walk as he passed from curio to curio. And when he fearlessly handled
      the box of rats and hammered upon it with cool insouciance, he beheld&mdash;for
      the first time in his life&mdash;a purl of admiration eddying in
      Marjorie's lovely eye, a certain softening of that eye. And then Verman
      spake and Penrod was forgotten. Marjorie's eye rested upon him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavily equipped chauffeur ascended the stairway, bearing the message
      that Mrs. Levy awaited her son and his lady. Thereupon, having devoured
      the last sound permitted (by the managers) to issue from Verman, Mr. Levy
      and Miss Jones departed to a real matinee at a real theatre, the limpid
      eyes of Marjorie looking back softly over her shoulder&mdash;but only at
      the tattooed wild boy. Nearly always it is woman who puts the irony into
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, perhaps because of sated curiosity, perhaps on account of a
      pin famine, the attendance began to languish. Only four responded to the
      next call of the band; the four dwindled to three; finally the
      entertainment was given for one blase auditor, and Schofield and Williams
      looked depressed. Then followed an interval when the band played in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o'clock Schofield and Williams were gloomily discussing
      various unpromising devices for startling the public into a renewal of
      interest, when another patron unexpectedly appeared and paid a cent for
      his admission. News of the Big Show and Museum of Curiosities had at last
      penetrated the far, cold spaces of interstellar niceness, for this new
      patron consisted of no less than Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, escaped
      in a white &ldquo;sailor suit&rdquo; from the Manor during a period of severe maternal
      and tutorial preoccupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself without parley, and the pufformance was offered for his
      entertainment with admirable conscientiousness. True to the Lady Clara
      caste and training, Roderick's pale, fat face expressed nothing except an
      impervious superiority and, as he sat, cold and unimpressed upon the front
      bench, like a large, white lump, it must be said that he made a
      discouraging audience &ldquo;to play to.&rdquo; He was not, however, unresponsive&mdash;far
      from it. He offered comment very chilling to the warm grandiloquence of
      the orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my uncle Ethelbert's dachshund,&rdquo; he remarked, at the beginning of
      the lecture. &ldquo;You better take him back if you don't want to get arrested.&rdquo;
       And when Penrod, rather uneasily ignoring the interruption, proceeded to
      the exploitation of the genuine, full-blooded Indian dog, Duke, &ldquo;Why don't
      you try to give that old dog away?&rdquo; asked Roderick. &ldquo;You couldn't sell
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My papa would buy me a lots better 'coon than that,&rdquo; was the information
      volunteered a little later, &ldquo;only I wouldn't want the nasty old thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman of the missing finger obtained no greater indulgence. &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said
      Roderick. &ldquo;We have two fox-terriers in our stables that took prizes at the
      kennel show, and their tails were BIT off. There's a man that always bites
      fox-terriers' tails off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my gosh, what a lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Sam Williams ignorantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with the show whether he likes it or not, Penrod. He's paid his
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman, confident in his own singular powers, chuckled openly at the
      failure of the other attractions to charm the frosty visitor, and, when
      his turn came, poured forth a torrent of conversation which was
      straightway damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten,&rdquo; said Mr. Bitts languidly. &ldquo;Anybody could talk like that. <i>I</i>
      could do it if I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman paused suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YES, you could!&rdquo; exclaimed Penrod, stung. &ldquo;Let's hear you do it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir!&rdquo; the other partner shouted. &ldquo;Let's just hear you DO it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I could if I wanted to,&rdquo; responded Roderick. &ldquo;I didn't say I
      WOULD.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! Knows he can't!&rdquo; sneered Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, too, if I try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let's hear you try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So challenged, the visitor did try, but, in the absence of an impartial
      jury, his effort was considered so pronounced a failure that he was howled
      down, derided, and mocked with great clamours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; said Roderick, when things had quieted down, &ldquo;if I couldn't get
      up a better show than this I'd sell out and leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not having enough presence of mind to inquire what he would sell out, his
      adversaries replied with mere formless yells of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could get up a better show than this with my left hand,&rdquo; Roderick
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what would you have in your ole show?&rdquo; asked Penrod, condescending
      to language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, what I'd HAVE. I'd have enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't get Herman and Verman in your ole show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and I wouldn't want 'em, either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what WOULD you have?&rdquo; insisted Penrod derisively. &ldquo;You'd have to
      have SUMPTHING&mdash;you couldn't be a show yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do YOU know?&rdquo; This was but meandering while waiting for ideas, and
      evoked another yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you could be a show all by yourself?&rdquo; demanded Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do YOU know I couldn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two white boys and two black boys shrieked their scorn of the boaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could, too!&rdquo; Roderick raised his voice to a sudden howl, obtaining a
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you tell us how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> know HOW, all right,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;If anybody asks you,
      you can just tell him I know HOW, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you can't DO anything,&rdquo; Sam began argumentatively. &ldquo;You talk about
      being a show all by yourself; what could you try to do? Show us sumpthing
      you can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say I was going to DO anything,&rdquo; returned the badgered one,
      still evading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, how'd you BE a show?&rdquo; Penrod demanded. &ldquo;WE got a show here,
      even if Herman didn't point or Verman didn't talk. Their father stabbed a
      man with a pitchfork, I guess, didn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do <i>I</i> know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess he's in jail, ain't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if their father is in jail? I didn't say he wasn't, did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, YOUR father ain't in jail, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never said he was, did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Penrod, &ldquo;how could you be a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
      stopped abruptly, staring at Roderick, the birth of an idea plainly
      visible in his altered expression. He had suddenly remembered his
      intention to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, about Rena Magsworth,
      and this recollection collided in his mind with the irritation produced by
      Roderick's claiming some mysterious attainment which would warrant his
      setting up as a show in his single person. Penrod's whole manner changed
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; he asked, almost overwhelmed by a prescience of something vast
      and magnificent, &ldquo;Roddy, are you any relation of Rena Magsworth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick had never heard of Rena Magsworth, although a concentration of
      the sentence yesterday pronounced upon her had burned, black and horrific,
      upon the face of every newspaper in the country. He was not allowed to
      read the journals of the day and his family's indignation over the
      sacrilegious coincidence of the name had not been expressed in his
      presence. But he saw that it was an awesome name to Penrod Schofield and
      Samuel Williams. Even Herman and Verman, though lacking many educational
      advantages on account of a long residence in the country, were informed on
      the subject of Rena Magsworth through hearsay, and they joined in the
      portentous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; repeated Penrod, &ldquo;honest, is Rena Magsworth some relation of
      yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is no obsession more dangerous to its victims than a conviction
      especially an inherited one&mdash;of superiority: this world is so full of
      Missourians. And from his earliest years Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior,
      had been trained to believe in the importance of the Magsworth family. At
      every meal he absorbed a sense of Magsworth greatness, and yet, in his
      infrequent meetings with persons of his own age and sex, he was treated as
      negligible. Now, dimly, he perceived that there was a Magsworth claim of
      some sort which was impressive, even to boys. Magsworth blood was the
      essential of all true distinction in the world, he knew. Consequently,
      having been driven into a cul-de-sac, as a result of flagrant and
      unfounded boasting, he was ready to take advantage of what appeared to be
      a triumphal way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; said Penrod again, with solemnity, &ldquo;is Rena Magsworth some
      relation of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IS she, Roddy?&rdquo; asked Sam, almost hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's my aunt!&rdquo; shouted Roddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence followed. Sam and Penrod, spellbound, gazed upon Roderick
      Magsworth Bitts, Junior. So did Herman and Verman. Roddy's staggering lie
      had changed the face of things utterly. No one questioned it; no one
      realized that it was much too good to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; said Penrod, in a voice tremulous with hope, &ldquo;Roddy, will you
      join our show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even he could see that the offer implied his being starred as the
      paramount attraction of a new order of things. It was obvious that he had
      swelled out suddenly, in the estimation of the other boys, to that
      importance which he had been taught to believe his native gift and natural
      right. The sensation was pleasant. He had often been treated with effusion
      by grown-up callers and by acquaintances of his mothers and sisters; he
      had heard ladies speak of him as &ldquo;charming&rdquo; and &ldquo;that delightful child,&rdquo;
       and little girls had sometimes shown him deference, but until this moment
      no boy had ever allowed him, for one moment, to presume even to equality.
      Now, in a trice, he was not only admitted to comradeship, but patently
      valued as something rare and sacred to be acclaimed and pedestalled. In
      fact, the very first thing that Schofield and Williams did was to find a
      box for him to stand upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misgivings roused in Roderick's bosom by the subsequent activities of
      the firm were not bothersome enough to make him forego his prominence as
      Exhibit A. He was not a &ldquo;quick-minded&rdquo; boy, and it was long (and much
      happened) before he thoroughly comprehended the causes of his new
      celebrity. He had a shadowy feeling that if the affair came to be heard of
      at home it might not be liked, but, intoxicated by the glamour and bustle
      which surround a public character, he made no protest. On the contrary, he
      entered whole-heartedly into the preparations for the new show. Assuming,
      with Sam's assistance, a blue moustache and &ldquo;side-burns,&rdquo; he helped in the
      painting of a new poster, which, supplanting the old one on the wall of
      the stable facing the cross-street, screamed bloody murder at the passers
      in that rather populous thoroughfare.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII RETIRING FROM THE SHOW BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Megaphones were constructed out of heavy wrapping-paper, and Penrod, Sam,
      and Herman set out in different directions, delivering vocally the
      inflammatory proclamation of the poster to a large section of the
      residential quarter, and leaving Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, with
      Verman in the loft, shielded from all deadhead eyes. Upon the return of
      the heralds, the Schofield and Williams Military Band played deafeningly,
      and an awakened public once more thronged to fill the coffers of the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prosperity smiled again. The very first audience after the acquisition of
      Roderick was larger than the largest of the morning. Master Bitts&mdash;the
      only exhibit placed upon a box&mdash;was a supercurio. All eyes fastened
      upon him and remained, hungrily feasting, throughout Penrod's luminous
      oration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the glory of one light must ever be the dimming of another. We dwell
      in a vale of seesaws&mdash;and cobwebs spin fastest upon laurel. Verman,
      the tattooed wild boy, speaking only in his native foreign languages,
      Verman the gay, Verman the caperer, capered no more; he chuckled no more,
      he beckoned no more, nor tapped his chest, nor wreathed his idolatrous
      face in smiles. Gone, all gone, were his little artifices for attracting
      the general attention to himself; gone was every engaging mannerism which
      had endeared him to the mercurial public. He squatted against the wall and
      glowered at the new sensation. It was the old story&mdash;the old, old
      story of too much temperament: Verman was suffering from artistic
      jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second audience contained a cash-paying adult, a spectacled young man
      whose poignant attention was very flattering. He remained after the
      lecture, and put a few questions to Roddy, which were answered rather
      confusedly upon promptings from Penrod. The young man went away without
      having stated the object of his interrogations, but it became quite plain,
      later in the day. This same object caused the spectacled young man to make
      several brief but stimulating calls directly after leaving the Schofield
      and Williams Big Show, and the consequences thereof loitered not by the
      wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Big Show was at high tide. Not only was the auditorium filled and
      throbbing; there was an indubitable line&mdash;by no means wholly juvenile&mdash;waiting
      for admission to the next pufformance. A group stood in the street
      examining the poster earnestly as it glowed in the long, slanting rays of
      the westward sun, and people in automobiles and other vehicles had halted
      wheel in the street to read the message so piquantly given to the world.
      These were the conditions when a crested victoria arrived at a gallop, and
      a large, chastely magnificent and highly flushed woman descended, and
      progressed across the yard with an air of violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of her, the adults of the waiting line hastily disappeared, and
      most of the pausing vehicles moved instantly on their way. She was
      followed by a stricken man in livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stairs to the auditorium were narrow and steep; Mrs. Roderick
      Magsworth Bitts was of a stout favour; and the voice of Penrod was audible
      during the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RE-MEM-BUR, gentilmun and lay-deeze, each and all are now gazing upon
      Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, the only living nephew of the great Rena
      Magsworth. She stuck ars'nic in the milk of eight separate and distinck
      people to put in their coffee and each and all of 'em died. The great
      ars'nic murderess, Rena Magsworth, gentilmun and lay-deeze, and Roddy's
      her only living nephew. She's a relation of all the Bitts family, but he's
      her one and only living nephew. RE-MEM-BUR! Next July she's goin' to be
      hung, and, each and all, you now see before you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod paused abruptly, seeing something before himself&mdash;the august
      and awful presence which filled the entryway. And his words (it should be
      related) froze upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before HERSELF, Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts saw her son&mdash;her scion&mdash;wearing
      a moustache and sideburns of blue, and perched upon a box flanked by
      Sherman and Verman, the Michigan rats, the Indian dog Duke, Herman, and
      the dog part alligator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roddy, also, saw something before himself. It needed no prophet to read
      the countenance of the dread apparition in the entryway. His mouth opened&mdash;remained
      open&mdash;then filled to capacity with a calamitous sound of grief not
      unmingled with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's reason staggered under the crisis. For a horrible moment he saw
      Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts approaching like some fatal mountain in
      avalanche. She seemed to grow larger and redder; lightnings played about
      her head; he had a vague consciousness of the audience spraying out in
      flight, of the squealings, tramplings and dispersals of a stricken field.
      The mountain was close upon him&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the open mouth of the hay-chute which went through the floor
      to the manger below. Penrod also went through the floor. He propelled
      himself into the chute and shot down, but not quite to the manger, for Mr.
      Samuel Williams had thoughtfully stepped into the chute a moment in
      advance of his partner. Penrod lit upon Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catastrophic noises resounded in the loft; volcanoes seemed to romp upon
      the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ensued a period when only a shrill keening marked the passing of
      Roderick as he was borne to the tumbril. Then all was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . Sunset, striking through a western window, rouged the walls of the
      Schofields' library, where gathered a joint family council and court
      martial of four&mdash;Mrs. Schofield, Mr. Schofield, and Mr. and Mrs.
      Williams, parents of Samuel of that ilk. Mr. Williams read aloud a
      conspicuous passage from the last edition of the evening paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prominent people here believed close relations of woman sentenced to
      hang. Angry denial by Mrs. R. Magsworth Bitts. Relationship admitted by
      younger member of family. His statement confirmed by boy-friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams, addressing her husband vehemently. &ldquo;We've all
      read it a dozen times. We've got plenty of trouble on our hands without
      hearing THAT again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Singularly enough, Mrs. Williams did not look troubled; she looked as if
      she were trying to look troubled. Mrs. Schofield wore a similar
      expression. So did Mr. Schofield. So did Mr. Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say when she called YOU up?&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield inquired
      breathlessly of Mrs. Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could hardly speak at first, and then when she did talk, she talked
      so fast I couldn't understand most of it, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just the same when she tried to talk to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield,
      nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did hear any one in such a state before,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
      Williams. &ldquo;So furious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite justly, of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And she said Penrod and Sam had enticed Roderick away from
      home&mdash;usually he's not allowed to go outside the yard except with his
      tutor or a servant&mdash;and had told him to say that horrible creature
      was his aunt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world do you suppose Sam and Penrod ever thought of such a
      thing as THAT!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;It must have been made up just
      for their 'show.' Della says there were just STREAMS going in and out all
      day. Of course it wouldn't have happened, but this was the day Margaret
      and I spend every month in the country with Aunt Sarah, and I didn't DREAM&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said one thing I thought rather tactless,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Williams.
      &ldquo;Of course we must allow for her being dreadfully excited and wrought up,
      but I do think it wasn't quite delicate in her, and she's usually the very
      soul of delicacy. She said that Roderick had NEVER been allowed to
      associate with&mdash;common boys&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning Sam and Penrod,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;Yes, she said that to me,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that the most awful thing about it,&rdquo; Mrs. Williams went on, &ldquo;was
      that, though she's going to prosecute the newspapers, many people would
      always believe the story, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I imagine they will,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield musingly. &ldquo;Of course you
      and I and everybody who really knows the Bitts and Magsworth families
      understand the perfect absurdity of it; but I suppose there are ever so
      many who'll believe it, no matter what the Bittses and Magsworths say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundreds and hundreds!&rdquo; said Mrs. Williams. &ldquo;I'm afraid it will be a
      great come-down for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield gently. &ldquo;A very great one&mdash;yes,
      a very, very great one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Williams, after a thoughtful pause, &ldquo;there's only
      one thing to be done, and I suppose it had better be done right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced toward the two gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mr. Schofield agreed. &ldquo;But where ARE they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you looked in the stable?&rdquo; asked his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I searched it. They've probably started for the far West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you look in the sawdust-box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that's where they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the early twilight, the now historic stable was approached by two
      fathers charged to do the only thing to be done. They entered the
      storeroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam!&rdquo; said Mr. Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing disturbed the twilight hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by means of a ladder, brought from the carriage-house, Mr. Schofield
      mounted to the top of the sawdust-box. He looked within, and discerned the
      dim outlines of three quiet figures, the third being that of a small dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys rose, upon command, descended the ladder after Mr. Schofield,
      bringing Duke with them, and stood before the authors of their being, who
      bent upon them sinister and threatening brows. With hanging heads and
      despondent countenances, each still ornamented with a moustache and an
      imperial, Penrod and Sam awaited sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a boy's lot: anything he does, anything whatever, may afterward
      turn out to have been a crime&mdash;he never knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And punishment and clemency are alike inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Williams took his son by the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You march home!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam marched, not looking back, and his father followed the small figure
      implacably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You goin' to whip me?&rdquo; quavered Penrod, alone with Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wash your face at that hydrant,&rdquo; said his father sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      About fifteen minutes later, Penrod, hurriedly entering the corner drug
      store, two blocks distant, was astonished to perceive a familiar form at
      the soda counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod,&rdquo; said Sam Williams. &ldquo;Want some sody? Come on. He didn't lick
      me. He didn't do anything to me at all. He gave me a quarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So'd mine,&rdquo; said Penrod.

      CHAPTER XVIII MUSIC
    </h2>
    <p>
      Boyhood is the longest time in life for a boy. The last term of the
      school-year is made of decades, not of weeks, and living through them is
      like waiting for the millennium. But they do pass, somehow, and at last
      there came a day when Penrod was one of a group that capered out from the
      gravelled yard of &ldquo;Ward School, Nomber Seventh,&rdquo; carolling a leave-taking
      of the institution, of their instructress, and not even forgetting Mr.
      Capps, the janitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, teacher! Good-bye, school! Good-bye, Cappsie, dern ole fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod sang the loudest. For every boy, there is an age when he &ldquo;finds his
      voice.&rdquo; Penrod's had not &ldquo;changed,&rdquo; but he had found it. Inevitably that
      thing had come upon his family and the neighbours; and his father, a
      somewhat dyspeptic man, quoted frequently the expressive words of the
      &ldquo;Lady of Shalott,&rdquo; but there were others whose sufferings were as
      poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vacation-time warmed the young of the world to pleasant languor; and a
      morning came that was like a brightly coloured picture in a child's fairy
      story. Miss Margaret Schofield, reclining in a hammock upon the front
      porch, was beautiful in the eyes of a newly made senior, well favoured and
      in fair raiment, beside her. A guitar rested lightly upon his knee, and he
      was trying to play&mdash;a matter of some difficulty, as the floor of the
      porch also seemed inclined to be musical. From directly under his feet
      came a voice of song, shrill, loud, incredibly piercing and incredibly
      flat, dwelling upon each syllable with incomprehensible reluctance to
      leave it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I have lands and earthly pow-wur.
     I'd give all for a now-wur,
     Whi-ilst setting at MY-Y-Y dear old mother's knee-ee,
     So-o-o rem-mem-bur whilst you're young&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Miss Schofield stamped heartily upon the musical floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Penrod,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;The lattice at the end of the porch is
      loose, and he crawls under and comes out all bugs. He's been having a
      dreadful singing fit lately&mdash;running away to picture shows and
      vaudeville, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Williams looked upon her yearningly. He touched a thrilling
      chord on his guitar and leaned nearer. &ldquo;But you said you have missed me,&rdquo;
       he began. &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Penrod drowned all other sounds.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;So-o-o rem-mem-bur, whi-i-ilst you're young,
     That the day-a-ys to you will come,
     When you're o-o-old and only in the way,
     Do not scoff at them BEE-cause&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PENROD!&rdquo; Miss Schofield stamped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DID say you'd missed me,&rdquo; said Mr. Robert Williams, seizing hurriedly
      upon the silence. &ldquo;Didn't you say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A livelier tune rose upward.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, you talk about your fascinating beauties,
     Of your dem-O-zells, your belles,
     But the littil dame I met, while in the city,
     She's par excellaws the queen of all the swells.
     She's sweeter far&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Margaret rose and jumped up and down repeatedly in a well-calculated area,
      whereupon the voice of Penrod cried chokedly, &ldquo;QUIT that!&rdquo; and there were
      subterranean coughings and sneezings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to choke a person to death?&rdquo; he inquired severely, appearing at
      the end of the porch, a cobweb upon his brow. And, continuing, he put into
      practice a newly acquired phrase, &ldquo;You better learn to be more considerick
      of other people's comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and grievedly he withdrew, passed to the sunny side of the house,
      reclined in the warm grass beside his wistful Duke, and presently sang
      again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;She's sweeter far than the flower I named her after,
     And the memery of her smile it haunts me YET!
     When in after years the moon is soffly beamun'
     And at eve I smell the smell of mignonette
     I will re-CALL that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pen-ROD!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield appeared at an open window upstairs, a book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Can't I stay home with a headache ONE morning
      from the office without having to listen to&mdash;I never DID hear such
      squawking!&rdquo; He retired from the window, having too impulsively called upon
      his Maker. Penrod, shocked and injured, entered the house, but presently
      his voice was again audible as far as the front porch. He was holding
      converse with his mother, somewhere in the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it? Sam Williams told me his mother said if Bob ever did
      think of getting married to Margaret, his mother said she'd like to know
      what in the name o' goodness they expect to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bang! Margaret thought it better to close the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute Penrod opened it. &ldquo;I suppose you want the whole family to
      get a sunstroke,&rdquo; he said reprovingly. &ldquo;Keepin' every breath of air out o'
      the house on a day like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he sat down implacably in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serious poetry of all languages has omitted the little brother; and
      yet he is one of the great trials of love&mdash;the immemorial burden of
      courtship. Tragedy should have found place for him, but he has been left
      to the haphazard vignettist of Grub Street. He is the grave and real
      menace of lovers; his head is sacred and terrible, his power illimitable.
      There is one way&mdash;only one&mdash;to deal with him; but Robert
      Williams, having a brother of Penrod's age, understood that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert had one dollar in the world. He gave it to Penrod immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enslaved forever, the new Rockefeller rose and went forth upon the
      highway, an overflowing heart bursting the floodgates of song.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;In her eyes the light of love was soffly gleamun',
     So sweetlay,
     So neatlay.
     On the banks the moon's soff light was brightly streamun',
     Words of love I then spoke TO her.
     She was purest of the PEW-er:
     'Littil sweetheart, do not sigh,
     Do not weep and do not cry.
     I will build a littil cottige just for yew-EW-EW and I.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      In fairness, it must be called to mind that boys older than Penrod have
      these wellings of pent melody; a wife can never tell when she is to
      undergo a musical morning, and even the golden wedding brings her no
      security, a man of ninety is liable to bust-loose in song, any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invalids murmured pitifully as Penrod came within hearing; and people
      trying to think cursed the day that they were born, when he went shrilling
      by. His hands in his pockets, his shining face uplifted to the sky of
      June, he passed down the street, singing his way into the heart's deepest
      hatred of all who heard him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;One evuning I was sturow-ling
     Midst the city of the DEAD,
     I viewed where all a-round me
     Their PEACE-full graves was SPREAD.
     But that which touched me mostlay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He had reached his journey's end, a junk-dealer's shop wherein lay the
      long-desired treasure of his soul&mdash;an accordion which might have
      possessed a high quality of interest for an antiquarian, being
      unquestionably a ruin, beautiful in decay, and quite beyond the
      sacrilegious reach of the restorer. But it was still able to disgorge
      sounds&mdash;loud, strange, compelling sounds, which could be heard for a
      remarkable distance in all directions; and it had one rich calf-like tone
      that had gone to Penrod's heart. He obtained the instrument for twenty-two
      cents, a price long since agreed upon with the junk-dealer, who falsely
      claimed a loss of profit, Shylock that he was! He had found the wreck in
      an alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this purchase suspended from his shoulder by a faded green cord,
      Penrod set out in a somewhat homeward direction, but not by the route he
      had just travelled, though his motive for the change was not humanitarian.
      It was his desire to display himself thus troubadouring to the gaze of
      Marjorie Jones. Heralding his advance by continuous experiments in the
      music of the future, he pranced upon his blithesome way, the faithful Duke
      at his heels. (It was easier for Duke than it would have been for a
      younger dog, because, with advancing age, he had begun to grow a little
      deaf.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning the corner nearest to the glamoured mansion of the Joneses, the
      boy jongleur came suddenly face to face with Marjorie, and, in the
      delicious surprise of the encounter, ceased to play, his hands, in
      agitation, falling from the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bareheaded, the sunshine glorious upon her amber curls, Marjorie was
      strolling hand-in-hand with her baby brother, Mitchell, four years old.
      She wore pink that day&mdash;unforgettable pink, with a broad, black
      patent-leather belt, shimmering reflections dancing upon its surface. How
      beautiful she was! How sacred the sweet little baby brother, whose
      privilege it was to cling to that small hand, delicately powdered with
      freckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Marjorie,&rdquo; said Penrod, affecting carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Marjorie, with unexpected cordiality. She bent over her baby
      brother with motherly affectations. &ldquo;Say 'howdy' to the gentymuns,
      Mitchy-Mitch,&rdquo; she urged sweetly, turning him to face Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WON'T!&rdquo; said Mitchy-Mitch, and, to emphasize his refusal, kicked the
      gentymuns upon the shin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's feelings underwent instant change, and in the sole occupation of
      disliking Mitchy-Mitch, he wasted precious seconds which might have been
      better employed in philosophic consideration of the startling example,
      just afforded, of how a given law operates throughout the universe in
      precisely the same manner perpetually. Mr. Robert Williams would have
      understood this, easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; Marjorie cried, and put Mitchy-Mitch behind her with too much
      sweetness. &ldquo;Maurice Levy's gone to Atlantic City with his mamma,&rdquo; she
      remarked conversationally, as if the kicking incident were quite closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothin',&rdquo; returned Penrod, keeping his eye uneasily upon
      Mitchy-Mitch. &ldquo;I know plenty people been better places than that&mdash;Chicago
      and everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was unconscious ingratitude in his low rating of Atlantic City, for
      it was largely to the attractions of that resort he owed Miss Jones'
      present attitude of friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, too, she was curious about the accordion. It would be dastardly
      to hint that she had noticed a paper bag which bulged the pocket of
      Penrod's coat, and yet this bag was undeniably conspicuous&mdash;&ldquo;and
      children are very like grown people sometimes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod brought forth the bag, purchased on the way at a drug store, and
      till this moment UNOPENED, which expresses in a word the depth of his
      sentiment for Marjorie. It contained an abundant fifteen-cents' worth of
      lemon drops, jaw-breakers, licorice sticks, cinnamon drops, and shopworn
      choclate creams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take all you want,&rdquo; he said, with off-hand generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Penrod Schofield,&rdquo; exclaimed the wholly thawed damsel, &ldquo;you nice
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothin',&rdquo; he returned airily. &ldquo;I got a good deal of money,
      nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;just around.&rdquo; With a cautious gesture he offered a jaw-breaker
      to Mitchy-Mitch, who snatched it indignantly and set about its absorption
      without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you play on that?&rdquo; asked Marjorie, with some difficulty, her cheeks
      being rather too hilly for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, her eyes sweet with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what he had come for. He threw back his head, lifted his eyes
      dreamily, as he had seen real musicians lift theirs, and distended the
      accordion preparing to produce the wonderful calf-like noise which was the
      instrument's great charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the distention evoked a long wail which was at once drowned in another
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow! Owowaoh! Wowohah! WaowWOW!&rdquo; shrieked Mitchy-Mitch and the accordion
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchy-Mitch, to emphasize his disapproval of the accordion, opening his
      mouth still wider, lost therefrom the jaw-breaker, which rolled in the
      dust. Weeping, he stooped to retrieve it, and Marjorie, to prevent him,
      hastily set her foot upon it. Penrod offered another jaw-breaker; but
      Mitchy-Mitch struck it from his hand, desiring the former, which had
      convinced him of its sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie moved inadvertently; whereupon Mitchy-Mitch pounced upon the
      remains of his jaw-breaker and restored them, with accretions, to his
      mouth. His sister, uttering a cry of horror, sprang to the rescue,
      assisted by Penrod, whom she prevailed upon to hold Mitchy-Mitch's mouth
      open while she excavated. This operation being completed, and Penrod's
      right thumb severely bitten, Mitchy-Mitch closed his eyes tightly,
      stamped, squealed, bellowed, wrung his hands, and then, unexpectedly,
      kicked Penrod again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod put a hand in his pocket and drew forth a copper two-cent piece,
      large, round, and fairly bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave it to Mitchy-Mitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchy-Mitch immediately stopped crying and gazed upon his benefactor with
      the eyes of a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter did Penrod&mdash;with complete approval from Mitchy-Mitch&mdash;play
      the accordion for his lady to his heart's content, and hers. Never had he
      so won upon her; never had she let him feel so close to her before. They
      strolled up and down upon the sidewalk, eating, one thought between them,
      and soon she had learned to play the accordion almost as well as he. So
      passed a happy hour, which the Good King Rene of Anjou would have envied
      them, while Mitchy-Mitch made friends with Duke, romped about his sister
      and her swain, and clung to the hand of the latter, at intervals, with
      fondest affection and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noon whistles failed to disturb this little Arcady; only the sound of
      Mrs. Jones' voice for the third time summoning Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch
      to lunch&mdash;sent Penrod on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could come back this afternoon, I guess,&rdquo; he said, in parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not goin' to be here. I'm goin' to Baby Rennsdale's party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked blank, as she intended he should. Having thus satisfied
      herself, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren't goin' to be any boys there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was instantly radiant again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marjorie&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish I was goin' to be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked shy, and turned away her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARJORIE JONES!&rdquo; (This was a voice from home.) &ldquo;HOW MANY MORE TIMES SHALL
      I HAVE TO CALL YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie moved away, her face still hidden from Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate, she turned quickly toward him, and said over her shoulder,
      all in a breath: &ldquo;Yes! Come again to-morrow morning and I'll be on the
      corner. Bring your 'cordion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she ran into the house, Mitchy-Mitch waving a loving hand to the boy
      on the sidewalk until the front door closed.

      CHAPTER XIX THE INNER BOY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Penrod went home in splendour, pretending that he and Duke were a long
      procession; and he made enough noise to render the auricular part of the
      illusion perfect. His own family were already at the lunch-table when he
      arrived, and the parade halted only at the door of the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh SOMETHING!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Schofield, clasping his bilious brow with both
      hands. &ldquo;Stop that noise! Isn't it awful enough for you to SING? Sit DOWN!
      Not with that thing on! Take that green rope off your shoulder! Now take
      that thing out of the dining-room and throw it in the ash-can! Where did
      you get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did I get what, papa?&rdquo; asked Penrod meekly, depositing the
      accordion in the hall just outside the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That da&mdash;that third-hand concertina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a 'cordian,&rdquo; said Penrod, taking his place at the table, and
      noticing that both Margaret and Mr. Robert Williams (who happened to be a
      guest) were growing red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care what you call it,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield irritably. &ldquo;I want to
      know where you got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's eyes met Margaret's: hers had a strained expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      She very slightly shook her head. Penrod sent Mr. Williams a grateful
      look, and might have been startled if he could have seen himself in a
      mirror at that moment; for he regarded Mitchy-Mitch with concealed but
      vigorous aversion and the resemblance would have horrified him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man gave it to me,&rdquo; he answered gently, and was rewarded by the visibly
      regained ease of his patron's manner, while Margaret leaned back in her
      chair and looked at her brother with real devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he'd have been glad to,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield. &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; In spite of the candy which he had consumed in company with
      Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch, Penrod had begun to eat lobster croquettes
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who WAS he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who do you mean, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man that gave you that ghastly Thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yessir. A man gave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Who WAS he?&rdquo; shouted Mr. Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was just walking along, and the man came up to me&mdash;it was
      right down in front of Colgate's, where most of the paint's rubbed off the
      fence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; The father used his most dangerous tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man that gave you the concertina?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I was walking along&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw him before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I was just walk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield, rising. &ldquo;I suppose every family has
      its secret enemies and this was one of ours. I must ask to be excused!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that, he went out crossly, stopping in the hall a moment before
      passing beyond hearing. And, after lunch, Penrod sought in vain for his
      accordion; he even searched the library where his father sat reading,
      though, upon inquiry, Penrod explained that he was looking for a misplaced
      schoolbook. He thought he ought to study a little every day, he said, even
      during vacation-time. Much pleased, Mr. Schofield rose and joined the
      search, finding the missing work on mathematics with singular ease&mdash;which
      cost him precisely the price of the book the following September.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod departed to study in the backyard. There, after a cautious survey
      of the neighbourhood, he managed to dislodge the iron cover of the
      cistern, and dropped the arithmetic within. A fine splash rewarded his
      listening ear. Thus assured that when he looked for that book again no one
      would find it for him, he replaced the cover, and betook himself pensively
      to the highway, discouraging Duke from following by repeated volleys of
      stones, some imaginary and others all too real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distant strains of brazen horns and the throbbing of drums were borne to
      him upon the kind breeze, reminding him that the world was made for joy,
      and that the Barzee and Potter Dog and Pony Show was exhibiting in a
      banlieue not far away. So, thither he bent his steps&mdash;the plentiful
      funds in his pocket burning hot holes all the way. He had paid twenty-two
      cents for the accordion, and fifteen for candy; he had bought the
      mercenary heart of Mitchy-Mitch for two: it certainly follows that there
      remained to him of his dollar, sixty-one cents&mdash;a fair fortune, and
      most unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived upon the populous and festive scene of the Dog and Pony Show, he
      first turned his attention to the brightly decorated booths which
      surrounded the tent. The cries of the peanut vendors, of the popcorn men,
      of the toy-balloon sellers, the stirring music of the band, playing before
      the performance to attract a crowd, the shouting of excited children and
      the barking of the dogs within the tent, all sounded exhilaratingly in
      Penrod's ears and set his blood a-tingle. Nevertheless, he did not
      squander his money or fling it to the winds in one grand splurge. Instead,
      he began cautiously with the purchase of an extraordinarily large pickle,
      which he obtained from an aged negress for his odd cent, too obvious a
      bargain to be missed. At an adjacent stand he bought a glass of raspberry
      lemonade (so alleged) and sipped it as he ate the pickle. He left nothing
      of either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, he entered a small restaurant-tent and for a modest nickel was
      supplied with a fork and a box of sardines, previously opened, it is true,
      but more than half full. He consumed the sardines utterly, but left the
      tin box and the fork, after which he indulged in an inexpensive half-pint
      of lukewarm cider, at one of the open booths. Mug in hand, a gentle glow
      radiating toward his surface from various centres of activity deep inside
      him, he paused for breath&mdash;and the cool, sweet cadences of the
      watermelon man fell delectably upon his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ice-cole WATER-melon; ice-cole water-MELON; the biggest slice of
      ICE-cole, ripe, red, ICE-cole, rich an' rare; the biggest slice of
      ice-cole watermelon ever cut by the hand of man! BUY our ICE-cole
      water-melon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, having drained the last drop of cider, complied with the
      watermelon man's luscious entreaty, and received a round slice of the
      fruit, magnificent in circumference and something over an inch in
      thickness. Leaving only the really dangerous part of the rind behind him,
      he wandered away from the vicinity of the watermelon man and supplied
      himself with a bag of peanuts, which, with the expenditure of a dime for
      admission, left a quarter still warm in his pocket. However, he managed to
      &ldquo;break&rdquo; the coin at a stand inside the tent, where a large, oblong paper
      box of popcorn was handed him, with twenty cents change. The box was too
      large to go into his pocket, but, having seated himself among some wistful
      Polack children, he placed it in his lap and devoured the contents at
      leisure during the performance. The popcorn was heavily larded with
      partially boiled molasses, and Penrod sandwiched mouthfuls of peanuts with
      gobs of this mass until the peanuts were all gone. After that, he ate with
      less avidity; a sense almost of satiety beginning to manifest itself to
      him, and it was not until the close of the performance that he disposed of
      the last morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the arena, and
      bought a caterwauling toy balloon, but showed no great enthusiasm in
      manipulating it. Near the exit, as he came out, was a hot-waffle stand
      which he had overlooked, and a sense of duty obliged him to consume the
      three waffles, thickly powdered with sugar, which the waffle man cooked
      for him upon command.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left a hottish taste in his mouth; they had not been quite up to his
      anticipation, indeed, and it was with a sense of relief that he turned to
      the &ldquo;hokey-pokey&rdquo; cart which stood close at hand, laden with square slabs
      of &ldquo;Neapolitan ice-cream&rdquo; wrapped in paper. He thought the ice-cream would
      be cooling, but somehow it fell short of the desired effect, and left a
      peculiar savour in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away, too languid to blow his balloon, and passed a fresh-taffy
      booth with strange indifference. A bare-armed man was manipulating the
      taffy over a hook, pulling a great white mass to the desired stage of
      &ldquo;candying,&rdquo; but Penrod did not pause to watch the operation; in fact, he
      averted his eyes (which were slightly glazed) in passing. He did not
      analyze his motives: simply, he was conscious that he preferred not to
      look at the mass of taffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason, he put a considerable distance between himself and the
      taffy-stand, but before long halted in the presence of a red-faced man who
      flourished a long fork over a small cooking apparatus and shouted
      jovially: &ldquo;Winnies! HERE'S your hot winnies! Hot winny-WURST! Food for the
      over-worked brain, nourishing for the weak stummick, entertaining for the
      tired business man! HERE'S your hot winnies, three for a nickel, a
      half-a-dime, the twentieth-pot-of-a-dollah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, above all nectar and ambrosia, was the favourite dish of Penrod
      Schofield. Nothing inside him now craved it&mdash;on the contrary! But
      memory is the great hypnotist; his mind argued against his inwards that
      opportunity knocked at his door: &ldquo;winny-wurst&rdquo; was rigidly forbidden by
      the home authorities. Besides, there was a last nickel in his pocket; and
      nature protested against its survival. Also, the redfaced man had himself
      proclaimed his wares nourishing for the weak stummick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod placed the nickel in the red hand of the red-faced man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate two of the three greasy, cigarlike shapes cordially pressed upon
      him in return. The first bite convinced him that he had made a mistake;
      these winnies seemed of a very inferior flavour, almost unpleasant, in
      fact. But he felt obliged to conceal his poor opinion of them, for fear of
      offending the red-faced man. He ate without haste or eagerness&mdash;so
      slowly, indeed, that he began to think the redfaced man might dislike him,
      as a deterrent of trade. Perhaps Penrod's mind was not working well, for
      he failed to remember that no law compelled him to remain under the eye of
      the red-faced man, but the virulent repulsion excited by his attempt to
      take a bite of the third sausage inspired him with at least an excuse for
      postponement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty good,&rdquo; he murmured feebly, placing the sausage in the pocket of
      his jacket with a shaking hand. &ldquo;Guess I'll save this one to eat at home,
      after&mdash;after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved sluggishly away, wishing he had not thought of dinner. A
      side-show, undiscovered until now, failed to arouse his interest, not even
      exciting a wish that he had known of its existence when he had money. For
      a time he stared without attraction; the weather-worn colours conveying no
      meaning to comprehension at a huge canvas poster depicting the chief his
      torpid eye. Then, little by little, the poster became more vivid to his
      consciousness. There was a greenish-tinted person in the tent, it seemed,
      who thrived upon a reptilian diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Penrod decided that it was time to go home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX BROTHERS OF ANGELS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, doctor,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield, with agitation and profound
      conviction, just after eight o'clock that evening, &ldquo;I shall ALWAYS believe
      in mustard plasters&mdash;mustard plasters and hot&mdash;water bags. If it
      hadn't been for them I don't believed he'd have LIVED till you got here&mdash;I
      do NOT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; called Mr. Schofield from the open door of a bedroom,
      &ldquo;Margaret, where did you put that aromatic ammonia? Where's Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had to find the aromatic spirits of ammonia himself, for Margaret
      was not in the house. She stood in the shadow beneath a maple tree near
      the street corner, a guitar-case in her hand; and she scanned with anxiety
      a briskly approaching figure. The arc light, swinging above, revealed this
      figure as that of him she awaited. He was passing toward the gate without
      seeing her, when she arrested him with a fateful whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BOB!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Robert Williams swung about hastily. &ldquo;Why, Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, take your guitar,&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly. &ldquo;I was afraid if father
      happened to find it he'd break it all to pieces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the startled Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm sure he knows it's yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;But what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bob,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I was waiting here to tell you. I was so afraid
      you'd try to come in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TRY!&rdquo; exclaimed the unfortunate young man, quite dumfounded. &ldquo;TRY to come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, before I warned you. I've been waiting here to tell you, Bob, you
      mustn't come near the house if I were you I'd stay away from even this
      neighbourhood&mdash;far away! For a while I don't think it would be
      actually SAFE for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, will you please&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all on account of that dollar you gave Penrod this morning,&rdquo; she
      walled. &ldquo;First, he bought that horrible concertina that made papa so
      furious&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Penrod didn't tell that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wait!&rdquo; she cried lamentably. &ldquo;Listen! He didn't tell at lunch, but he
      got home about dinner-time in the most&mdash;well! I've seen pale people
      before, but nothing like Penrod. Nobody could IMAGINE it&mdash;not unless
      they'd seen him! And he looked, so STRANGE, and kept making such unnatural
      faces, and at first all he would say was that he'd eaten a little piece of
      apple and thought it must have some microbes on it. But he got sicker and
      sicker, and we put him to bed&mdash;and then we all thought he was going
      to die&mdash;and, of COURSE, no little piece of apple would have&mdash;well,
      and he kept getting worse and then he said he'd had a dollar. He said he'd
      spent it for the concertina, and watermelon, and chocolate-creams, and
      licorice sticks, and lemon-drops, and peanuts, and jaw-breakers, and
      sardines, and raspberry lemonade, and pickles, and popcorn, and ice-cream,
      and cider, and sausage&mdash;there was sausage in his pocket, and mamma
      says his jacket is ruined&mdash;and cinnamon drops&mdash;and waffles&mdash;and
      he ate four or five lobster croquettes at lunch&mdash;and papa said, 'Who
      gave you that dollar?' Only he didn't say 'WHO'&mdash;he said something
      horrible, Bob! And Penrod thought he was going to die, and he said you
      gave it to him, and oh! it was just pitiful to hear the poor child, Bob,
      because he thought he was dying, you see, and he blamed you for the whole
      thing. He said if you'd only let him alone and not given it to him, he'd
      have grown up to be a good man&mdash;and now he couldn't! I never heard
      anything so heart-rending&mdash;he was so weak he could hardly whisper,
      but he kept trying to talk, telling us over and over it was all your
      fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness Mr. Williams' facial expression could not be seen, but his
      voice sounded hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he still in a great deal of pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say the crisis is past,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;but the doctor's still up
      there. He said it was the acutest case of indigestion he had ever treated
      in the whole course of his professional practice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course <i>I</i> didn't know what he'd do with the dollar,&rdquo; said
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began plaintively, &ldquo;Margaret, you don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never seen papa and mamma so upset about anything,&rdquo; she said, rather
      primly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they're upset about ME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ARE all very much upset,&rdquo; returned Margaret, more starch in her tone
      as she remembered not only Penrod's sufferings but a duty she had vowed
      herself to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret! YOU don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; she said firmly and, also, with a rhetorical complexity which
      breeds a suspicion of pre-rehearsal&mdash;&ldquo;Robert, for the present I can
      only look at it in one way: when you gave that money to Penrod you put
      into the hands of an unthinking little child a weapon which might be, and,
      indeed was, the means of his undoing. Boys are not respon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you saw me give him the dollar, and you didn't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert!&rdquo; she checked him with increasing severity. &ldquo;I am only a woman and
      not accustomed to thinking everything out on the spur of the moment; but I
      cannot change my mind. Not now, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think I'd better not come in to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Not for WEEKS! Papa would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Margaret,&rdquo; he urged plaintively, &ldquo;how can you blame me for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not used the word 'blame,'&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;But I must insist
      that for your carelessness to&mdash;to wreak such havoc&mdash;cannot fail
      to&mdash;to lessen my confidence in your powers of judgment. I cannot
      change my convictions in this matter&mdash;not to-night&mdash;and I cannot
      remain here another instant. The poor child may need me. Robert,
      good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With chill dignity she withdrew, entered the house, and returned to the
      sick-room, leaving the young man in outer darkness to brood upon his crime&mdash;and
      upon Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sincere invalid became convalescent upon the third day; and a week
      elapsed, then, before he found an opportunity to leave the house
      unaccompanied&mdash;save by Duke. But at last he set forth and approached
      the Jones neighbourhood in high spirits, pleasantly conscious of his
      pallor, hollow cheeks, and other perquisites of illness provocative of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thought troubled him a little because it gave him a sense of
      inferiority to a rival. He believed, against his will, that Maurice Levy
      could have successfully eaten chocolate-creams, licorice sticks,
      lemon-drops, jaw-breakers, peanuts, waffles, lobster croquettes, sardines,
      cinnamon-drops, watermelon, pickles, popcorn, ice-cream and sausage with
      raspberry lemonade and cider. Penrod had admitted to himself that Maurice
      could do it and afterward attend to business, or pleasure, without the
      slightest discomfort; and this was probably no more than a fair estimate
      of one of the great constitutions of all time. As a digester, Maurice Levy
      would have disappointed a Borgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Maurice was still at Atlantic City&mdash;and now the
      convalescent's heart leaped. In the distance he saw Marjorie coming&mdash;in
      pink again, with a ravishing little parasol over her head. And alone! No
      Mitchy-Mitch was to mar this meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod increased the feebleness of his steps, now and then leaning upon
      the fence as if for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Marjorie?&rdquo; he said, in his best sick-room voice, as she
      came near.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his pained amazement, she proceeded on her way, her nose at a
      celebrated elevation&mdash;an icy nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cut him dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw his invalid's airs to the winds, and hastened after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marjorie,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;what's the matter? Are you mad? Honest, that day
      you said to come back next morning, and you'd be on the corner, I was
      sick. Honest, I was AWFUL sick, Marjorie! I had to have the doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DOCTOR!&rdquo; She whirled upon him, her lovely eyes blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess WE'VE had to have the doctor enough at OUR house, thanks to you,
      Mister Penrod Schofield. Papa says you haven't got NEAR sense enough to
      come in out of the rain, after what you did to poor little Mitchy-Mitch&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he's sick in bed YET!&rdquo; Marjorie went on, with unabated fury.
      &ldquo;And papa says if he ever catches you in this part of town&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT'D I do to Mitchy-Mitch?&rdquo; gasped Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough what you did to Mitchy-Mitch!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You gave
      him that great, big, nasty two-cent piece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mitchy-Mitch swallowed it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And papa says if he ever just lays eyes on you, once, in this
      neighbourhood&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Penrod had started for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his embittered heart there was increasing a critical disapproval of the
      Creator's methods. When He made pretty girls, thought Penrod, why couldn't
      He have left out their little brothers!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI RUPE COLLINS
    </h2>
    <p>
      For several days after this, Penrod thought of growing up to be a monk,
      and engaged in good works so far as to carry some kittens (that otherwise
      would have been drowned) and a pair of Margaret's outworn dancing-slippers
      to a poor, ungrateful old man sojourning in a shed up the alley. And
      although Mr. Robert Williams, after a very short interval, began to leave
      his guitar on the front porch again, exactly as if he thought nothing had
      happened, Penrod, with his younger vision of a father's mood, remained
      coldly distant from the Jones neighbourhood. With his own family his
      manner was gentle, proud and sad, but not for long enough to frighten
      them. The change came with mystifying abruptness at the end of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Duke who brought it about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke could chase a much bigger dog out of the Schofields' yard and far
      down the street. This might be thought to indicate unusual valour on the
      part of Duke and cowardice on that of the bigger dogs whom he undoubtedly
      put to rout. On the contrary, all such flights were founded in mere
      superstition, for dogs are even more superstitious than boys and coloured
      people; and the most firmly established of all dog superstitions is that
      any dog&mdash;be he the smallest and feeblest in the world&mdash;can whip
      any trespasser whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rat-terrier believes that on his home grounds he can whip an elephant.
      It follows, of course, that a big dog, away from his own home, will run
      from a little dog in the little dog's neighbourhood. Otherwise, the big
      dog must face a charge of inconsistency, and dogs are as consistent as
      they are superstitious. A dog believes in war, but he is convinced that
      there are times when it is moral to run; and the thoughtful physiognomist,
      seeing a big dog fleeing out of a little dog's yard, must observe that the
      expression of the big dog's face is more conscientious than alarmed: it is
      the expression of a person performing a duty to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod understood these matters perfectly; he knew that the gaunt brown
      hound Duke chased up the alley had fled only out of deference to a custom,
      yet Penrod could not refrain from bragging of Duke to the hound's owner, a
      fat-faced stranger of twelve or thirteen, who had wandered into the
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better keep that ole yellow dog o' yours back,&rdquo; said Penrod
      ominously, as he climbed the fence. &ldquo;You better catch him and hold him
      till I get mine inside the yard again. Duke's chewed up some pretty bad
      bulldogs around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat-faced boy gave Penrod a fishy stare. &ldquo;You'd oughta learn him not
      to do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It'll make him sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger laughed raspingly and gazed up the alley, where the hound,
      having come to a halt, now coolly sat down, and, with an expression of
      roguish benevolence, patronizingly watched the tempered fury of Duke,
      whose assaults and barkings were becoming perfunctory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll make Duke sick?&rdquo; Penrod demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eatin' dead bulldogs people leave around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not improvisation but formula, adapted from other occasions to
      the present encounter; nevertheless, it was new to Penrod, and he was so
      taken with it that resentment lost itself in admiration. Hastily
      committing the gem to memory for use upon a dog-owning friend, he inquired
      in a sociable tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your dog's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan. You better call your ole pup, 'cause Dan eats LIVE dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dan's actions poorly supported his master's assertion, for, upon Duke's
      ceasing to bark, Dan rose and showed the most courteous interest in making
      the little, old dog's acquaintance. Dan had a great deal of manner, and it
      became plain that Duke was impressed favourably in spite of former
      prejudice, so that presently the two trotted amicably back to their
      masters and sat down with the harmonious but indifferent air of having
      known each other intimately for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were received without comment, though both boys looked at them
      reflectively for a time. It was Penrod who spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What number you go to?&rdquo; (In an &ldquo;oral lesson in English,&rdquo; Penrod had been
      instructed to put this question in another form: &ldquo;May I ask which of our
      public schools you attend?&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? What number do I go to?&rdquo; said the stranger, contemptuously. &ldquo;I don't
      go to NO number in vacation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean when it ain't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third,&rdquo; returned the fat-faced boy. &ldquo;I got 'em ALL scared in THAT
      school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of?&rdquo; innocently asked Penrod, to whom &ldquo;the Third&rdquo;&mdash;in a distant
      part of town&mdash;was undiscovered country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of? I guess you'd soon see what of, if you ever was in that school
      about one day. You'd be lucky if you got out alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the teachers mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boy frowned with bitter scorn. &ldquo;Teachers! Teachers don't order
      ME around, I can tell you! They're mighty careful how they try to run over
      Rupe Collins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Rupe Collins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; echoed the fat-faced boy incredulously. &ldquo;Say, ain't you got
      ANY sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, wouldn't you be just as happy if you had SOME sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo; Penrod's answer, like the look he lifted to the impressive
      stranger, was meek and placative. &ldquo;Rupe Collins is the principal at your
      school, guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other yelled with jeering laughter, and mocked Penrod's manner and
      voice. &ldquo;'Rupe Collins is the principal at your school, I guess!'&rdquo; He
      laughed harshly again, then suddenly showed truculence. &ldquo;Say, 'bo, whyn't
      you learn enough to go in the house when it rains? What's the matter of
      you, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; urged Penrod timidly, &ldquo;nobody ever TOLD me who Rupe Collins is: I
      got a RIGHT to think he's the principal, haven't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat-faced boy shook his head disgustedly. &ldquo;Honest, you make me sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's expression became one of despair. &ldquo;Well, who IS he?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who IS he?'&rdquo; mocked the other, with a scorn that withered. &ldquo;'Who IS he?'
      ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Penrod was humiliated but relieved: he felt that he had proved
      himself criminally ignorant, yet a peril seemed to have passed. &ldquo;Rupe
      Collins is your name, then, I guess. I kind of thought it was, all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat-faced boy still appeared embittered, burlesquing this speech in a
      hateful falsetto. &ldquo;'Rupe Collins is YOUR name, then, I guess!' Oh, you
      'kind of thought it was, all the time,' did you?&rdquo; Suddenly concentrating
      his brow into a histrionic scowl he thrust his face within an inch of
      Penrod's. &ldquo;Yes, sonny, Rupe Collins is my name, and you better look out
      what you say when he's around or you'll get in big trouble! YOU UNDERSTAND
      THAT, 'BO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was cowed but fascinated: he felt that there was something
      dangerous and dashing about this newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, feebly, drawing back. &ldquo;My name's Penrod Schofield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I reckon your father and mother ain't got good sense,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Collins promptly, this also being formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Cause if they had they'd of give you a good name!&rdquo; And the agreeable
      youth instantly rewarded himself for the wit with another yell of rasping
      laughter, after which he pointed suddenly at Penrod's right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd you get that wart on your finger?&rdquo; he demanded severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which finger?&rdquo; asked the mystified Penrod, extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The middle one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Rupe Collins, seizing and vigorously twisting the
      wartless finger naively offered for his inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit!&rdquo; shouted Penrod in agony. &ldquo;QUEE-yut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say your prayers!&rdquo; commanded Rupe, and continued to twist the luckless
      finger until Penrod writhed to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OW!&rdquo; The victim, released, looked grievously upon the still painful
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Rupe's scornful expression altered to one of contrition. &ldquo;Well, I
      declare!&rdquo; he exclaimed remorsefully. &ldquo;I didn't s'pose it would hurt. Turn
      about's fair play; so now you do that to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He extended the middle finger of his left hand and Penrod promptly seized
      it, but did not twist it, for he was instantly swung round with his back
      to his amiable new acquaintance: Rupe's right hand operated upon the back
      of Penrod's slender neck; Rupe's knee tortured the small of Penrod's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OW!&rdquo; Penrod bent far forward involuntarily and went to his knees again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lick dirt,&rdquo; commanded Rupe, forcing the captive's face to the sidewalk;
      and the suffering Penrod completed this ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins evinced satisfaction by means of his horse laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd last jest about one day up at the Third!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You'd come
      runnin' home, yellin' 'MOM-MUH, MOM-muh,' before recess was over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn't,&rdquo; Penrod protested rather weakly, dusting his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I w&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here,&rdquo; said the fat-faced boy, darkly, &ldquo;what you mean,
      counterdicking me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced a step and Penrod hastily qualified his contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, I don't THINK I would. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better look out!&rdquo; Rupe moved closer, and unexpectedly grasped the
      back of Penrod's neck again. &ldquo;Say, 'I WOULD run home yellin' &ldquo;MOM-muh!&rdquo;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow! I WOULD run home yellin' 'Mom-muh.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Rupe, giving the helpless nape a final squeeze. &ldquo;That's the
      way we do up at the Third.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod rubbed his neck and asked meekly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you do that to any boy up at the Third?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here now,&rdquo; said Rupe, in the tone of one goaded beyond all endurance,
      &ldquo;YOU say if I can! You better say it quick, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you could,&rdquo; Penrod interposed hastily, with the pathetic semblance
      of a laugh. &ldquo;I only said that in fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 'fun'!&rdquo; repeated Rupe stormily. &ldquo;You better look out how you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I SAID I wasn't in earnest!&rdquo; Penrod retreated a few steps. &ldquo;<i>I</i>
      knew you could, all the time. I expect <i>I</i> could do it to some of the
      boys up at the Third, myself. Couldn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there must be SOME boy up there that I could&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they ain't! You better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect not, then,&rdquo; said Penrod, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You BETTER 'expect not.' Didn't I tell you once you'd never get back
      alive if you ever tried to come up around the Third? You want me to SHOW
      you how we do up there, 'bo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began a slow and deadly advance, whereupon Penrod timidly offered a
      diversion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Rupe, I got a box of rats in our stable under a glass cover, so you
      can watch 'em jump around when you hammer on the box. Come on and look at
      'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the fat-faced boy, slightly mollified. &ldquo;We'll let Dan
      kill 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, SIR! I'm goin' to keep 'em. They're kind of pets; I've had 'em all
      summer&mdash;I got names for em, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here, 'bo. Did you hear me say we'll let 'Dan kill 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I won't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT won't you?&rdquo; Rupe became sinister immediately. &ldquo;It seems to me you're
      gettin' pretty fresh around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Collins once more brought into play the dreadful eye-to-eye scowl as
      practised &ldquo;up at the Third,&rdquo; and, sometimes, also by young leading men
      upon the stage. Frowning appallingly, and thrusting forward his underlip,
      he placed his nose almost in contact with the nose of Penrod, whose eyes
      naturally became crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan kills the rats. See?&rdquo; hissed the fat-faced boy, maintaining the
      horrible juxtaposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; said Penrod, swallowing. &ldquo;I don't want 'em much.&rdquo; And
      when the pose had been relaxed, he stared at his new friend for a moment,
      almost with reverence. Then he brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Rupe!&rdquo; he cried enthusiastically, as he climbed the fence.
      &ldquo;We'll give our dogs a little live meat&mdash;'bo!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII THE IMITATOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the dinner-table, that evening, Penrod Surprised his family by
      remarking, in a voice they had never heard him attempt&mdash;a law-giving
      voice of intentional gruffness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man that's makin' a hunderd dollars a month is makin' good money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Mr. Schofield, staring, for the previous conversation had
      concerned the illness of an infant relative in Council Bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any man that's makin' a hunderd dollars a month is makin' good money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS he talking about!&rdquo; Margaret appealed to the invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, frowning, &ldquo;that's what foremen at the ladder works
      get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How in the world do you know?&rdquo; asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I KNOW it! A hunderd dollars a month is good money, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; said the father, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I only said it was good money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield shook his head, dismissing the subject; and here he made a
      mistake: he should have followed up his son's singular contribution to the
      conversation. That would have revealed the fact that there was a certain
      Rupe Collins whose father was a foreman at the ladder works. All clues are
      important when a boy makes his first remark in a new key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Good money'?&rdquo; repeated Margaret, curiously. &ldquo;What is 'good' money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod turned upon her a stern glance. &ldquo;Say, wouldn't you be just as happy
      if you had SOME sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod!&rdquo; shouted his father. But Penrod's mother gazed with dismay at her
      son: he had never before spoken like that to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield might have been more dismayed than she was, if she had
      realized that it was the beginning of an epoch. After dinner, Penrod was
      slightly scalded in the back as the result of telling Della, the cook,
      that there was a wart on the middle finger of her right hand. Della thus
      proving poor material for his new manner to work upon, he approached Duke,
      in the backyard, and, bending double, seized the lowly animal by the
      forepaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let you know my name's Penrod Schofield,&rdquo; hissed the boy. He protruded
      his underlip ferociously, scowled, and thrust forward his head until his
      nose touched the dog's. &ldquo;And you better look out when Penrod Schofield's
      around, or you'll get in big trouble! YOU UNDERSTAN' THAT, 'BO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day, and the next, the increasing change in Penrod puzzled and
      distressed his family, who had no idea of its source.
    </p>
    <p>
      How might they guess that hero-worship takes such forms? They were vaguely
      conscious that a rather shabby boy, not of the neighbourhood, came to
      &ldquo;play&rdquo; with Penrod several times; but they failed to connect this
      circumstance with the peculiar behaviour of the son of the house, whose
      ideals (his father remarked) seemed to have suddenly become identical with
      those of Gyp the Blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, for Penrod himself, &ldquo;life had taken on new meaning, new
      richness.&rdquo; He had become a fighting man&mdash;in conversation at least.
      &ldquo;Do you want to know how I do when they try to slip up on me from behind?&rdquo;
       he asked Della. And he enacted for her unappreciative eye a scene of
      fistic manoeuvres wherein he held an imaginary antagonist helpless in a
      net of stratagems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently, when he was alone, he would outwit, and pummel this same
      enemy, and, after a cunning feint, land a dolorous stroke full upon a face
      of air. &ldquo;There! I guess you'll know better next time. That's the way we do
      up at the Third!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, in solitary pantomime, he encountered more than one opponent at
      a time, for numbers were apt to come upon him treacherously, especially at
      a little after his rising hour, when he might be caught at a disadvantage&mdash;perhaps
      standing on one leg to encase the other in his knickerbockers. Like
      lightning, he would hurl the trapping garment from him, and, ducking and
      pivoting, deal great sweeping blows among the circle of sneaking devils.
      (That was how he broke the clock in his bedroom.) And while these battles
      were occupying his attention, it was a waste of voice to call him to
      breakfast, though if his mother, losing patience, came to his room, she
      would find him seated on the bed pulling at a stocking. &ldquo;Well, ain't I
      coming fast as I CAN?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the table and about the house generally he was bumptious, loud with
      fatuous misinformation, and assumed a domineering tone, which neither
      satire nor reproof seemed able to reduce: but it was among his own
      intimates that his new superiority was most outrageous. He twisted the
      fingers and squeezed the necks of all the boys of the neighbourhood,
      meeting their indignation with a hoarse and rasping laugh he had acquired
      after short practice in the stable, where he jeered and taunted the
      lawn-mower, the garden-scythe and the wheelbarrow quite out of
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likewise he bragged to the other boys by the hour, Rupe Collins being the
      chief subject of encomium&mdash;next to Penrod himself. &ldquo;That's the way we
      do up at the Third,&rdquo; became staple explanation of violence, for Penrod,
      like Tartarin, was plastic in the hands of his own imagination, and at
      times convinced himself that he really was one of those dark and murderous
      spirits exclusively of whom &ldquo;the Third&rdquo; was composed&mdash;according to
      Rupe Collins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when Penrod had exhausted himself repeating to nausea accounts of
      the prowess of himself and his great friend, he would turn to two other
      subjects for vainglory. These were his father and Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mothers must accept the fact that between babyhood and manhood their sons
      do not boast of them. The boy, with boys, is a Choctaw; and either the
      influence or the protection of women is shameful. &ldquo;Your mother won't let
      you,&rdquo; is an insult. But, &ldquo;My father won't let me,&rdquo; is a dignified
      explanation and cannot be hooted. A boy is ruined among his fellows if he
      talks much of his mother or sisters; and he must recognize it as his duty
      to offer at least the appearance of persecution to all things ranked as
      female, such as cats and every species of fowl. But he must champion his
      father and his dog, and, ever, ready to pit either against any challenger,
      must picture both as ravening for battle and absolutely unconquerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, of course, had always talked by the code, but, under the new
      stimulus, Duke was represented virtually as a cross between Bob, Son of
      Battle, and a South American vampire; and this in spite of the fact that
      Duke himself often sat close by, a living lie, with the hope of peace in
      his heart. As for Penrod's father, that gladiator was painted as of
      sentiments and dimensions suitable to a super-demon composed of equal
      parts of Goliath, Jack Johnson and the Emperor Nero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Penrod's walk was affected; he adopted a gait which was a kind of
      taunting swagger; and, when he passed other children on the street, he
      practised the habit of feinting a blow; then, as the victim dodged, he
      rasped the triumphant horse laugh which he gradually mastered to horrible
      perfection. He did this to Marjorie Jones&mdash;ay! this was their next
      meeting, and such is Eros, young! What was even worse, in Marjorie's
      opinion, he went on his way without explanation, and left her standing on
      the corner talking about it, long after he was out of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within five days from his first encounter with Rupe Collins, Penrod had
      become unbearable. He even almost alienated Sam Williams, who for a time
      submitted to finger twisting and neck squeezing and the new style of
      conversation, but finally declared that Penrod made him &ldquo;sick.&rdquo; He made
      the statement with fervour, one sultry afternoon, in Mr. Schofield's
      stable, in the presence of Herman and Verman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better look out, 'bo,&rdquo; said Penrod, threateningly. &ldquo;I'll show you a
      little how we do up at the Third.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up at the Third!&rdquo; Sam repeated with scorn. &ldquo;You haven't ever been up
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't?&rdquo; cried Penrod. &ldquo;I HAVEN'T?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky here!&rdquo; Penrod, darkly argumentative, prepared to perform the
      eye-to-eye business. &ldquo;When haven't I been up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't NEVER been up there!&rdquo; In spite of Penrod's closely
      approaching nose Sam maintained his ground, and appealed for confirmation.
      &ldquo;Has he, Herman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' reckon so,&rdquo; said Herman, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT!&rdquo; Penrod transferred his nose to the immediate vicinity of Herman's
      nose. &ldquo;You don't reckon so, 'bo, don't you? You better look out how you
      reckon around here! YOU UNDERSTAN' THAT, 'BO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman bore the eye-to-eye very well; indeed, it seemed to please him, for
      he continued to laugh while Verman chuckled delightedly. The brothers had
      been in the country picking berries for a week, and it happened that this
      was their first experience of the new manifestation of Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HAVEN'T I been up at the Third?&rdquo; the sinister Penrod demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' reckon so. How come you ast ME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you just hear me SAY I been up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Herman mischievously, &ldquo;hearin' ain't believin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod clutched him by the back of the neck, but Herman, laughing loudly,
      ducked and released himself at once, retreating to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take that back!&rdquo; Penrod shouted, striking out wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' git mad,&rdquo; begged the small darky, while a number of blows falling
      upon his warding arms failed to abate his amusement, and a sound one upon
      the cheek only made him laugh the more unrestrainedly. He behaved exactly
      as if Penrod were tickling him, and his brother, Verman, rolled with joy
      in a wheelbarrow. Penrod pummelled till he was tired, and produced no
      greater effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he panted, desisting finally. &ldquo;NOW I reckon you know whether I
      been up there or not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman rubbed his smitten cheek. &ldquo;Pow!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Pow-ee! You cert'ny
      did lan' me good one NAT time! Oo-ee! she HURT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get hurt worse'n that,&rdquo; Penrod assured him, &ldquo;if you stay around
      here much. Rupe Collins is comin' this afternoon, he said. We're goin' to
      make some policemen's billies out of the rake handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go' spoil new rake you' pa bought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do WE care? I and Rupe got to have billies, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you make 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melt lead and pour in a hole we're goin' to make in the end of 'em. Then
      we're goin' to carry 'em in our pockets, and if anybody says anything to
      us&mdash;OH, oh! look out! They won't get a crack on the head&mdash;OH,
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When's Rupe Collins coming?&rdquo; Sam Williams inquired rather uneasily. He
      had heard a great deal too much of this personage, but as yet the pleasure
      of actual acquaintance had been denied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's liable to be here any time,&rdquo; answered Penrod. &ldquo;You better look out.
      You'll be lucky if you get home alive, if you stay till HE comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't afraid of him,&rdquo; Sam returned, conventionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, too!&rdquo; (There was some truth in the retort.) &ldquo;There ain't any boy
      in this part of town but me that wouldn't be afraid of him. You'd be
      afraid to talk to him. You wouldn't get a word out of your mouth before
      old Rupie'd have you where you'd wished you never come around HIM, lettin'
      on like you was so much! YOU wouldn't run home yellin' 'Mom-muh' or
      nothin'! OH, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who Rupe Collins?&rdquo; asked Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Who Rupe Collins?'&rdquo; Penrod mocked, and used his rasping laugh, but,
      instead of showing fright, Herman appeared to think he was meant to laugh,
      too; and so he did, echoed by Verman. &ldquo;You just hang around here a little
      while longer,&rdquo; Penrod added, grimly, &ldquo;and you'll find out who Rupe Collins
      is, and I pity YOU when you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he go' do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see; that's all! You just wait and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a brown hound ran into the stable through the alley door,
      wagged a greeting to Penrod, and fraternized with Duke. The fat-faced boy
      appeared upon the threshold and gazed coldly about the little company in
      the carriage-house, whereupon the coloured brethren, ceasing from
      merriment, were instantly impassive, and Sam Williams moved a little
      nearer the door leading into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, Sam regarded the newcomer as a redoubtable if not ominous
      figure. He was a head taller than either Sam or Penrod; head and shoulders
      taller than Herman, who was short for his age; and Verman could hardly be
      used for purposes of comparison at all, being a mere squat brown spot, not
      yet quite nine years on this planet. And to Sam's mind, the aspect of Mr.
      Collins realized Penrod's portentous foreshadowings. Upon the fat face
      there was an expression of truculent intolerance which had been cultivated
      by careful habit to such perfection that Sam's heart sank at sight of it.
      A somewhat enfeebled twin to this expression had of late often decorated
      the visage of Penrod, and appeared upon that ingenuous surface now, as he
      advanced to welcome the eminent visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host swaggered toward the door with a great deal of shoulder movement,
      carelessly feinting a slap at Verman in passing, and creating by various
      means the atmosphere of a man who has contemptuously amused himself with
      underlings while awaiting an equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, 'bo!&rdquo; Penrod said in the deepest voice possible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who you callin' 'bo?&rdquo; was the ungracious response, accompanied by
      immediate action of a similar nature. Rupe held Penrod's head in the crook
      of an elbow and massaged his temples with a hard-pressing knuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only in fun, Rupie,&rdquo; pleaded the sufferer, and then, being set
      free, &ldquo;Come here, Sam,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laughed pityingly. &ldquo;Pshaw, I ain't goin' to hurt you. Come on.&rdquo;
       Sam, maintaining his position near the other door, Penrod went to him and
      caught him round the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watch me, Rupie!&rdquo; Penrod called, and performed upon Sam the knuckle
      operation which he had himself just undergone, Sam submitting
      mechanically, his eyes fixed with increasing uneasiness upon Rupe Collins.
      Sam had a premonition that something even more painful than Penrod's
      knuckle was going to be inflicted upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT don' hurt,&rdquo; said Penrod, pushing him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does, too!&rdquo; Sam rubbed his temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puh! It didn't hurt me, did it, Rupie? Come on in, Rupe: show this baby
      where he's got a wart on his finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You showed me that trick,&rdquo; Sam objected. &ldquo;You already did that to me. You
      tried it twice this afternoon and I don't know how many times before, only
      you weren't strong enough after the first time. Anyway, I know what it is,
      and I don't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Rupe,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Make the baby lick dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this bidding, Rupe approached, while Sam, still protesting, moved to
      the threshold of the outer door; but Penrod seized him by the shoulders
      and swung him indoors with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little baby wants to run home to its Mom-muh! Here he is, Rupie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon was Penrod's treachery to an old comrade properly rewarded, for
      as the two struggled, Rupe caught each by the back of the neck,
      simultaneously, and, with creditable impartiality, forced both boys to
      their knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lick dirt!&rdquo; he commanded, forcing them still forward, until their faces
      were close to the stable floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he received a real surprise. With a loud whack something
      struck the back of his head, and, turning, he beheld Verman in the act of
      lifting a piece of lath to strike again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Em moys ome!&rdquo; said Verman, the Giant Killer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tongue-tie',&rdquo; Herman explained. &ldquo;He say, let 'em boys alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupe addressed his host briefly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chase them nigs out o' here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' call me nig,&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;I mine my own biznuss. You let 'em boys
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupe strode across the still prostrate Sam, stepped upon Penrod, and,
      equipping his countenance with the terrifying scowl and protruded jaw,
      lowered his head to the level of Herman's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nig, you'll be lucky if you leave here alive!&rdquo; And he leaned forward till
      his nose was within less than an inch of Herman's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could be felt that something awful was about to happen, and Penrod, as
      he rose from the floor, suffered an unexpected twinge of apprehension and
      remorse: he hoped that Rupe wouldn't REALLY hurt Herman. A sudden dislike
      of Rupe and Rupe's ways rose within him, as he looked at the big boy
      overwhelming the little darky with that ferocious scowl. Penrod, all at
      once, felt sorry about something indefinable; and, with equal vagueness,
      he felt foolish. &ldquo;Come on, Rupe,&rdquo; he suggested, feebly, &ldquo;let Herman go,
      and let's us make our billies out of the rake handle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rake handle, however, was not available, if Rupe had inclined to
      favour the suggestion. Verman had discarded his lath for the rake, which
      he was at this moment lifting in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ole black nigger,&rdquo; the fat-faced boy said venomously to Herman, &ldquo;I'm
      agoin' to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had allowed his nose to remain too long near Herman's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod's familiar nose had been as close with only a ticklish spinal
      effect upon the not very remote descendant of Congo man-eaters. The result
      produced by the glare of Rupe's unfamiliar eyes, and by the dreadfully
      suggestive proximity of Rupe's unfamiliar nose, was altogether different.
      Herman's and Verman's Bangala great-grandfathers never considered people
      of their own jungle neighbourhood proper material for a meal, but they
      looked upon strangers especially truculent strangers&mdash;as distinctly
      edible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod and Sam heard Rupe suddenly squawk and bellow; saw him writhe and
      twist and fling out his arms like flails, though without removing his face
      from its juxtaposition; indeed, for a moment, the two heads seemed even
      closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they separated&mdash;and battle was on!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII COLOURED TROOPS IN ACTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      How neat and pure is the task of the chronicler who has the tale to tell
      of a &ldquo;good rousing fight&rdquo; between boys or men who fight in the &ldquo;good old
      English way,&rdquo; according to a model set for fights in books long before Tom
      Brown went to Rugby. There are seconds and rounds and rules of fair-play,
      and always there is great good feeling in the end&mdash;though sometimes,
      to vary the model, &ldquo;the Butcher&rdquo; defeats the hero&mdash;and the chronicler
      who stencils this fine old pattern on his page is certain of applause as
      the stirrer of &ldquo;red blood.&rdquo; There is no surer recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Herman and Verman set to 't the record must be no more than a few
      fragments left by the expurgator. It has been perhaps sufficiently
      suggested that the altercation in Mr. Schofield's stable opened with
      mayhem in respect to the aggressor's nose. Expressing vocally his
      indignation and the extremity of his pained surprise, Mr. Collins stepped
      backward, holding his left hand over his nose, and striking at Herman with
      his right. Then Verman hit him with the rake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verman struck from behind. He struck as hard as he could. And he struck
      with the tines down&mdash;For, in his simple, direct African way he wished
      to kill his enemy, and he wished to kill him as soon as possible. That was
      his single, earnest purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this account, Rupe Collins was peculiarly unfortunate. He was plucky
      and he enjoyed conflict, but neither his ambitions nor his anticipations
      had ever included murder. He had not learned that an habitually aggressive
      person runs the danger of colliding with beings in one of those lower
      stages of evolution wherein theories about &ldquo;hitting below the belt&rdquo; have
      not yet made their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rake glanced from the back of Rupe's head to his shoulder, but it
      felled him. Both darkies jumped full upon him instantly, and the three
      rolled and twisted upon the stable-floor, unloosing upon the air sincere
      maledictions closely connected with complaints of cruel and unusual
      treatment; while certain expressions of feeling presently emanating from
      Herman and Verman indicated that Rupe Collins, in this extremity, was
      proving himself not too slavishly addicted to fighting by rule. Dan and
      Duke, mistaking all for mirth, barked gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the panting, pounding, yelling heap issued words and phrases hitherto
      quite unknown to Penrod and Sam; also, a hoarse repetition in the voice of
      Rupe concerning his ear left it not to be doubted that additional mayhem
      was taking place. Appalled, the two spectators retreated to the doorway
      nearest the yard, where they stood dumbly watching the cataclysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle increased in primitive simplicity: time and again the howling
      Rupe got to his knees only to go down again as the earnest brothers, in
      their own way, assisted him to a more reclining position. Primal forces
      operated here, and the two blanched, slightly higher products of
      evolution, Sam and Penrod, no more thought of interfering than they would
      have thought of interfering with an earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, out of the ruck rose Verman, disfigured and maniacal. With a wild
      eye he looked about him for his trusty rake; but Penrod, in horror, had
      long since thrown the rake out into the yard. Naturally, it had not seemed
      necessary to remove the lawn-mower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frantic eye of Verman fell upon the lawn-mower, and instantly he
      leaped to its handle. Shrilling a wordless war-cry, he charged, propelling
      the whirling, deafening knives straight upon the prone legs of Rupe
      Collins. The lawn-mower was sincerely intended to pass longitudinally over
      the body of Mr. Collins from heel to head; and it was the time for a
      death-song. Black Valkyrie hovered in the shrieking air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut his gizzud out!&rdquo; shrieked Herman, urging on the whirling knives.
    </p>
    <p>
      They touched and lacerated the shin of Rupe, as, with the supreme agony of
      effort a creature in mortal peril puts forth before succumbing, he tore
      himself free of Herman and got upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman was up as quickly. He leaped to the wall and seized the
      garden-scythe that hung there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm go to cut you' gizzud out,&rdquo; he announced definitely, &ldquo;an' eat it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rupe Collins had never run from anybody (except his father) in his life;
      he was not a coward; but the present situation was very, very unusual. He
      was already in a badly dismantled condition, and yet Herman and Verman
      seemed discontented with their work: Verman was swinging the grass-cutter
      about for a new charge, apparently still wishing to mow him, and Herman
      had made a quite plausible statement about what he intended to do with the
      scythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rupe paused but for an extremely condensed survey of the horrible advance
      of the brothers, and then, uttering a blood-curdled scream of fear, ran
      out of the stable and up the alley at a speed he had never before
      attained, so that even Dan had hard work to keep within barking distance.
      And a 'cross-shoulder glance, at the corner, revealing Verman and Herman
      in pursuit, the latter waving his scythe overhead, Mr. Collins slackened
      not his gait, but, rather, out of great anguish, increased it; the while a
      rapidly developing purpose became firm in his mind&mdash;and ever after so
      remained&mdash;not only to refrain from visiting that neighbourhood again,
      but never by any chance to come within a mile of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the alley door, Penrod and Sam watched the flight, and were without
      words. When the pursuit rounded the corner, the two looked wanly at each
      other, but neither spoke until the return of the brothers from the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman and Verman came back, laughing and chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiyi!&rdquo; cackled Herman to Verman, as they came, &ldquo;See 'at ole boy run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who-ee!&rdquo; Verman shouted in ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nev' did see boy run so fas'!&rdquo; Herman continued, tossing the scythe into
      the wheelbarrow. &ldquo;I bet he home in bed by viss time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Verman roared with delight, appearing to be wholly unconscious that the
      lids of his right eye were swollen shut and that his attire, not too
      finical before the struggle, now entitled him to unquestioned rank as a
      sansculotte. Herman was a similar ruin, and gave as little heed to his
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked dazedly from Herman to Verman and back again. So did Sam
      Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herman,&rdquo; said Penrod, in a weak voice, &ldquo;you wouldn't HONEST of cut his
      gizzard out, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Me? I don' know. He mighty mean ole boy!&rdquo; Herman shook his head
      gravely, and then, observing that Verman was again convulsed with unctuous
      merriment, joined laughter with his brother. &ldquo;Sho'! I guess I uz dess
      TALKIN' whens I said 'at! Reckon he thought I meant it, f'm de way he tuck
      an' run. Hiyi! Reckon he thought ole Herman bad man! No, suh! I uz dess
      talkin', 'cause I nev' would cut NObody! I ain' tryin' git in no jail&mdash;NO,
      suh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked at the scythe: he looked at Herman. He looked at the
      lawn-mower, and he looked at Verman. Then he looked out in the yard at the
      rake. So did Sam Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Verman,&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;We ain' go' 'at stove-wood f' supper
      yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giggling reminiscently, the brothers disappeared leaving silence behind
      them in the carriage-house. Penrod and Sam retired slowly into the shadowy
      interior, each glancing, now and then, with a preoccupied air, at the
      open, empty doorway where the late afternoon sunshine was growing ruddy.
      At intervals one or the other scraped the floor reflectively with the side
      of his shoe. Finally, still without either having made any effort at
      conversation, they went out into the yard and stood, continuing their
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sam, at last, &ldquo;I guess it's time I better be gettin' home. So
      long, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, Sam,&rdquo; said Penrod, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a solemn gaze he watched his friend out of sight. Then he went slowly
      into the house, and after an interval occupied in a unique manner,
      appeared in the library, holding a pair of brilliantly gleaming shoes in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield, reading the evening paper, glanced frowningly over it at
      his offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, papa,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;I found your shoes where you'd taken 'em off
      in your room, to put on your slippers, and they were all dusty. So I took
      'em out on the back porch and gave 'em a good blacking. They shine up
      fine, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be d-dud-dummed!&rdquo; said the startled Mr. Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was zigzagging back to normal.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV &ldquo;LITTLE GENTLEMAN&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The midsummer sun was stinging hot outside the little barber-shop next to
      the corner drug store and Penrod, undergoing a toilette preliminary to his
      very slowly approaching twelfth birthday, was adhesive enough to retain
      upon his face much hair as it fell from the shears. There is a mystery
      here: the tonsorial processes are not unagreeable to manhood; in truth,
      they are soothing; but the hairs detached from a boy's head get into his
      eyes, his ears, his nose, his mouth, and down his neck, and he does
      everywhere itch excruciatingly. Wherefore he blinks, winks, weeps,
      twitches, condenses his countenance, and squirms; and perchance the
      barber's scissors clip more than intended&mdash;belike an outlying flange
      of ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;muh&mdash;OW!&rdquo; said Penrod, this thing having happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D' I touch y' up a little?&rdquo; inquired the barber, smiling falsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ooh&mdash;UH!&rdquo; The boy in the chair offered inarticulate protest, as the
      wound was rubbed with alum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT don't hurt!&rdquo; said the barber. &ldquo;You WILL get it, though, if you don't
      sit stiller,&rdquo; he continued, nipping in the bud any attempt on the part of
      his patient to think that he already had &ldquo;it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pfuff!&rdquo; said Penrod, meaning no disrespect, but endeavoring to dislodge a
      temporary moustache from his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to see how still that little Georgie Bassett sits,&rdquo; the barber
      went on, reprovingly. &ldquo;I hear everybody says he's the best boy in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pfuff! PHIRR!&rdquo; There was a touch of intentional contempt in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't heard nobody around the neighbourhood makin' no such remarks,&rdquo;
       added the barber, &ldquo;about nobody of the name of Penrod Schofield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, clearing his mouth after a struggle, &ldquo;who wants 'em
      to? Ouch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear they call Georgie Bassett the 'little gentleman,'&rdquo; ventured the
      barber, provocatively, meeting with instant success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They better not call ME that,&rdquo; returned Penrod truculently. &ldquo;I'd like to
      hear anybody try. Just once, that's all! I bet they'd never try it ag&mdash;&mdash;OUCH!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What'd you do to 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right what I'd DO! I bet they wouldn't want to call me that
      again long as they lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd you do if it was a little girl? You wouldn't hit her, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd&mdash;&mdash;Ouch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't hit a little girl, would you?&rdquo; the barber persisted,
      gathering into his powerful fingers a mop of hair from the top of Penrod's
      head and pulling that suffering head into an unnatural position. &ldquo;Doesn't
      the Bible say it ain't never right to hit the weak sex?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow! SAY, look OUT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you'd go and punch a pore, weak, little girl, would you?&rdquo; said the
      barber, reprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who said I'd hit her?&rdquo; demanded the chivalrous Penrod. &ldquo;I bet I'd
      FIX her though, all right. She'd see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't call her names, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn't! What hurt is it to call anybody names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that SO!&rdquo; exclaimed the barber. &ldquo;Then you was intending what I heard
      you hollering at Fisher's grocery delivery wagon driver fer a favour, the
      other day when I was goin' by your house, was you? I reckon I better tell
      him, because he says to me after-WERDS if he ever lays eyes on you when
      you ain't in your own yard, he's goin' to do a whole lot o' things you
      ain't goin' to like! Yessir, that's what he says to ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He better catch me first, I guess, before he talks so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the barber, &ldquo;that ain't sayin' what you'd do if a young
      lady ever walked up and called you a little gentleman. <i>I</i> want to
      hear what you'd do to her. I guess I know, though&mdash;come to think of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd sick that pore ole dog of yours on her cat, if she had one, I
      expect,&rdquo; guessed the barber derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I would not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what WOULD you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd do enough. Don't worry about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose it was a boy, then: what'd you do if a boy come up to you
      and says, 'Hello, little gentleman'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd be lucky,&rdquo; said Penrod, with a sinister frown, &ldquo;if he got home
      alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose it was a boy twice your size?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let him try,&rdquo; said Penrod ominously. &ldquo;You just let him try. He'd
      never see daylight again; that's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barber dug ten active fingers into the helpless scalp before him and
      did his best to displace it, while the anguished Penrod, becoming
      instantly a seething crucible of emotion, misdirected his natural
      resentment into maddened brooding upon what he would do to a boy &ldquo;twice
      his size&rdquo; who should dare to call him &ldquo;little gentleman.&rdquo; The barber shook
      him as his father had never shaken him; the barber buffeted him, rocked
      him frantically to and fro; the barber seemed to be trying to wring his
      neck; and Penrod saw himself in staggering zigzag pictures, destroying
      large, screaming, fragmentary boys who had insulted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torture stopped suddenly; and clenched, weeping eyes began to see
      again, while the barber applied cooling lotions which made Penrod smell
      like a coloured housemaid's ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what,&rdquo; asked the barber, combing the reeking locks gently, &ldquo;what
      would it make you so mad fer, to have somebody call you a little
      gentleman? It's a kind of compliment, as it were, you might say. What
      would you want to hit anybody fer THAT fer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the mind of Penrod, this question was without meaning or
      reasonableness. It was within neither his power nor his desire to analyze
      the process by which the phrase had become offensive to him, and was now
      rapidly assuming the proportions of an outrage. He knew only that his
      gorge rose at the thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just let 'em try it!&rdquo; he said threateningly, as he slid down from the
      chair. And as he went out of the door, after further conversation on the
      same subject, he called back those warning words once more: &ldquo;Just let 'em
      try it! Just once&mdash;that's all <i>I</i> ask 'em to. They'll find out
      what they GET!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barber chuckled. Then a fly lit on the barber's nose and he slapped at
      it, and the slap missed the fly but did not miss the nose. The barber was
      irritated. At this moment his birdlike eye gleamed a gleam as it fell upon
      customers approaching: the prettiest little girl in the world, leading by
      the hand her baby brother, Mitchy-Mitch, coming to have Mitchy-Mitch's
      hair clipped, against the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot day and idle, with little to feed the mind&mdash;and the
      barber was a mischievous man with an irritated nose. He did his worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the brooding Penrod pursued his homeward way; no great
      distance, but long enough for several one-sided conflicts with malign
      insulters made of thin air. &ldquo;You better NOT call me that!&rdquo; he muttered.
      &ldquo;You just try it, and you'll get what other people got when THEY tried it.
      You better not ack fresh with ME! Oh, you WILL, will you?&rdquo; He delivered a
      vicious kick full upon the shins of an iron fence-post, which suffered
      little, though Penrod instantly regretted his indiscretion. &ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; he
      grunted, hopping; and went on after bestowing a look of awful hostility
      upon the fence-post. &ldquo;I guess you'll know better next time,&rdquo; he said, in
      parting, to this antagonist. &ldquo;You just let me catch you around here again
      and I'll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His voice sank to inarticulate but ominous
      murmurings. He was in a dangerous mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearing home, however, his belligerent spirit was diverted to happier
      interests by the discovery that some workmen had left a caldron of tar in
      the cross-street, close by his father's stable. He tested it, but found it
      inedible. Also, as a substitute for professional chewing-gum it was
      unsatisfactory, being insufficiently boiled down and too thin, though of a
      pleasant, lukewarm temperature. But it had an excess of one quality&mdash;it
      was sticky. It was the stickiest tar Penrod had ever used for any purposes
      whatsoever, and nothing upon which he wiped his hands served to rid them
      of it; neither his polka-dotted shirt waist nor his knickerbockers;
      neither the fence, nor even Duke, who came unthinkingly wagging out to
      greet him, and retired wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, tar is tar. Much can be done with it, no matter what its
      condition; so Penrod lingered by the caldron, though from a neighbouring
      yard could be heard the voices of comrades, including that of Sam
      Williams. On the ground about the caldron were scattered chips and sticks
      and bits of wood to the number of a great multitude. Penrod mixed
      quantities of this refuse into the tar, and interested himself in seeing
      how much of it he could keep moving in slow swirls upon the ebon surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other surprises were arranged for the absent workmen. The caldron was
      almost full, and the surface of the tar near the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod endeavoured to ascertain how many pebbles and brickbats, dropped
      in, would cause an overflow. Labouring heartily to this end, he had almost
      accomplished it, when he received the suggestion for an experiment on a
      much larger scale. Embedded at the corner of a grassplot across the street
      was a whitewashed stone, the size of a small watermelon and serving no
      purpose whatever save the questionable one of decoration. It was easily
      pried up with a stick; though getting it to the caldron tested the full
      strength of the ardent labourer. Instructed to perform such a task, he
      would have sincerely maintained its impossibility but now, as it was
      unbidden, and promised rather destructive results, he set about it with
      unconquerable energy, feeling certain that he would be rewarded with a
      mighty splash. Perspiring, grunting vehemently, his back aching and all
      muscles strained, he progressed in short stages until the big stone lay at
      the base of the caldron. He rested a moment, panting, then lifted the
      stone, and was bending his shoulders for the heave that would lift it over
      the rim, when a sweet, taunting voice, close behind him, startled him
      cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, LITTLE GENTLEMAN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod squawked, dropped the stone, and shouted, &ldquo;Shut up, you dern fool!&rdquo;
       purely from instinct, even before his about-face made him aware who had so
      spitefully addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Marjorie Jones. Always dainty, and prettily dressed, she was in
      speckless and starchy white to-day, and a refreshing picture she made,
      with the new-shorn and powerfully scented Mitchy-Mitch clinging to her
      hand. They had stolen up behind the toiler, and now stood laughing
      together in sweet merriment. Since the passing of Penrod's Rupe Collins
      period he had experienced some severe qualms at the recollection of his
      last meeting with Marjorie and his Apache behaviour; in truth, his heart
      instantly became as wax at sight of her, and he would have offered her
      fair speech; but, alas! in Marjorie's wonderful eyes there shone a
      consciousness of new powers for his undoing, and she denied him
      opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, OH!&rdquo; she cried, mocking his pained outcry. &ldquo;What a way for a LITTLE
      GENTLEMAN to talk! Little gentleman don't say wicked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marjorie!&rdquo; Penrod, enraged and dismayed, felt himself stung beyond all
      endurance. Insult from her was bitterer to endure than from any other.
      &ldquo;Don't you call me that again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, LITTLE GENTLEMAN?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped his foot. &ldquo;You better stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie sent into his furious face her lovely, spiteful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little gentleman, little gentleman, little gentleman!&rdquo; she said
      deliberately. &ldquo;How's the little gentleman, this afternoon? Hello, little
      gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, quite beside himself, danced eccentrically. &ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; he howled.
      &ldquo;Dry up, dry up, dry up, dry UP!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mitchy-Mitch shouted with delight and applied a finger to the side of the
      caldron&mdash;a finger immediately snatched away and wiped upon a
      handkerchief by his fastidious sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ittle gellamun!&rdquo; said Mitchy-Mitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better look out!&rdquo; Penrod whirled upon this small offender with grim
      satisfaction. Here was at least something male that could without
      dishonour be held responsible. &ldquo;You say that again, and I'll give you the
      worst&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will NOT!&rdquo; snapped Marjorie, instantly vitriolic. &ldquo;He'll say just
      whatever he wants to, and he'll say it just as MUCH as he wants to. Say it
      again, Mitchy-Mitch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ittle gellamun!&rdquo; said Mitchy-Mitch promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow-YAH!&rdquo; Penrod's tone-production was becoming affected by his mental
      condition. &ldquo;You say that again, and I'll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Mitchy-Mitch,&rdquo; cried Marjorie. &ldquo;He can't do a thing. He don't
      DARE! Say it some more, Mitchy-Mitch&mdash;say it a whole lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mitchy-Mitch, his small, fat face shining with confidence in his immunity,
      complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ittle gellamun!&rdquo; he squeaked malevolently. &ldquo;'Ittle gellamun! 'Ittle
      gellamun! 'Ittle gellamun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The desperate Penrod bent over the whitewashed rock, lifted it, and then&mdash;outdoing
      Porthos, John Ridd, and Ursus in one miraculous burst of strength&mdash;heaved
      it into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late. The big stone descended into the precise midst of the
      caldron and Penrod got his mighty splash. It was far, far beyond his
      expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spontaneously there were grand and awful effects&mdash;volcanic spectacles
      of nightmare and eruption. A black sheet of eccentric shape rose out of
      the caldron and descended upon the three children, who had no time to
      evade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After it fell, Mitchy-Mitch, who stood nearest the caldron, was the
      thickest, though there was enough for all. Br'er Rabbit would have fled
      from any of them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV TAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch got their breath, they used it vocally; and
      seldom have more penetrating sounds issued from human throats.
      Coincidentally, Marjorie, quite baresark, laid hands upon the largest
      stick within reach and fell upon Penrod with blind fury. He had the
      presence of mind to flee, and they went round and round the caldron, while
      Mitchy-Mitch feebly endeavoured to follow&mdash;his appearance, in this
      pursuit, being pathetically like that of a bug fished out of an ink-well,
      alive but discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attracted by the riot, Samuel Williams made his appearance, vaulting a
      fence, and was immediately followed by Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett.
      They stared incredulously at the extraordinary spectacle before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little GEN-TIL-MUN!&rdquo; shrieked Marjorie, with a wild stroke that landed
      full upon Penrod's tarry cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OOOCH!&rdquo; bleated Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Penrod!&rdquo; shouted Sam Williams, recognizing him by the voice. For an
      instant he had been in some doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; exclaimed Georgie Bassett. &ldquo;WHAT does this mean?&rdquo; That
      was Georgie's style, and had helped to win him his title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie leaned, panting, upon her stick. &ldquo;I cu-called&mdash;uh&mdash; him&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
       she sobbed&mdash;&ldquo;I called him a lul-little&mdash;oh&mdash;gentleman! And
      oh&mdash;lul-look!&mdash;oh! lul-look at my du-dress! Lul-look at Mumitchy&mdash;oh&mdash;Mitch&mdash;oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unexpectedly, she smote again&mdash;with results&mdash;and then, seizing
      the indistinguishable hand of Mitchy-Mitch, she ran wailing homeward down
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Little gentleman'?&rdquo; said Georgie Bassett, with some evidences of
      disturbed complacency. &ldquo;Why, that's what they call ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you ARE one, too!&rdquo; shouted the maddened Penrod. &ldquo;But you better
      not let anybody call ME that! I've stood enough around here for one day,
      and you can't run over ME, Georgie Bassett. Just you put that in your
      gizzard and smoke it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody has a perfect right,&rdquo; said Georgie, with, dignity, &ldquo;to call a
      person a little gentleman. There's lots of names nobody ought to call, but
      this one's a NICE&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unavenged bruises were distributed all over Penrod, both upon his body and
      upon his spirit. Driven by subtle forces, he had dipped his hands in
      catastrophe and disaster: it was not for a Georgie Bassett to beard him.
      Penrod was about to run amuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't called you a little gentleman, yet,&rdquo; said Georgie. &ldquo;I only said
      it. Anybody's got a right to SAY it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not around ME! You just try it again and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall say it,&rdquo; returned Georgie, &ldquo;all I please. Anybody in this town
      has a right to SAY 'little gentleman'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bellowing insanely, Penrod plunged his right hand into the caldron, rushed
      upon Georgie and made awful work of his hair and features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, it was but the beginning! Sam Williams and Maurice Levy screamed
      with delight, and, simultaneously infected, danced about the struggling
      pair, shouting frantically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little gentleman! Little gentleman! Sick him, Georgie! Sick him, little
      gentleman! Little gentleman! Little gentleman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The infuriated outlaw turned upon them with blows and more tar, which gave
      Georgie Bassett his opportunity and later seriously impaired the purity of
      his fame. Feeling himself hopelessly tarred, he dipped both hands
      repeatedly into the caldron and applied his gatherings to Penrod. It was
      bringing coals to Newcastle, but it helped to assuage the just wrath of
      Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four boys gave a fine imitation of the Laocoon group complicated by an
      extra figure frantic splutterings and chokings, strange cries and stranger
      words issued from this tangle; hands dipped lavishly into the
      inexhaustible reservoir of tar, with more and more picturesque results.
      The caldron had been elevated upon bricks and was not perfectly balanced;
      and under a heavy impact of the struggling group it lurched and went
      partly over, pouring forth a Stygian tide which formed a deep pool in the
      gutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fate of Master Roderick Bitts, that exclusive and immaculate
      person, to make his appearance upon the chaotic scene at this juncture.
      All in the cool of a white &ldquo;sailor suit,&rdquo; he turned aside from the path of
      duty&mdash;which led straight to the house of a maiden aunt&mdash;and
      paused to hop with joy upon the sidewalk. A repeated epithet continuously
      half panted, half squawked, somewhere in the nest of gladiators, caught
      his ear, and he took it up excitedly, not knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little gentleman!&rdquo; shouted Roderick, jumping up and down in childish
      glee. &ldquo;Little gentleman! Little gentleman! Lit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frightful figure tore itself free from the group, encircled this
      innocent bystander with a black arm, and hurled him headlong. Full length
      and flat on his face went Roderick into the Stygian pool. The frightful
      figure was Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, the pack flung themselves upon him again, and, carrying them
      with him, he went over upon Roderick, who from that instant was as active
      a belligerent as any there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began the Great Tar Fight, the origin of which proved, afterward, so
      difficult for parents to trace, owing to the opposing accounts of the
      combatants. Marjorie said Penrod began it; Penrod said Mitchy-Mitch began
      it; Sam Williams said Georgie Bassett began it; Georgie and Maurice Levy
      said Penrod began it; Roderick Bitts, who had not recognized his first
      assailant, said Sam Williams began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody thought of accusing the barber. But the barber did not begin it; it
      was the fly on the barber's nose that began it&mdash;though, of course,
      something else began the fly. Somehow, we never manage to hang the real
      offender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end came only with the arrival of Penrod's mother, who had been having
      a painful conversation by telephone with Mrs. Jones, the mother of
      Marjorie, and came forth to seek an errant son. It is a mystery how she
      was able to pick out her own, for by the time she got there his voice was
      too hoarse to be recognizable. Mr. Schofield's version of things was that
      Penrod was insane. &ldquo;He's a stark, raving lunatic!&rdquo; declared the father,
      descending to the library from a before-dinner interview with the outlaw,
      that evening. &ldquo;I'd send him to military school, but I don't believe they'd
      take him. Do you know WHY he says all that awfulness happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Margaret and I were trying to scrub him,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Schofield
      wearily, &ldquo;he said 'everybody' had been calling him names.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Names!'&rdquo; snorted her husband. &ldquo;'Little gentleman!' THAT'S the vile
      epithet they called him! And because of it he wrecks the peace of six
      homes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH! Yes; he told us about it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield, moaning. &ldquo;He told us
      several hundred times, I should guess, though I didn't count. He's got it
      fixed in his head, and we couldn't get it out. All we could do was to put
      him in the closet. He'd have gone out again after those boys if we hadn't.
      I don't know WHAT to make of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mystery to ME!&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;And he refuses to explain why
      he objects to being called 'little gentleman.' Says he'd do the same thing&mdash;and
      worse&mdash;if anybody dared to call him that again. He said if the
      President of the United States called him that he'd try to whip him. How
      long did you have him locked up in the closet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield warningly. &ldquo;About two hours; but I don't think
      it softened his spirit at all, because when I took him to the barber's to
      get his hair clipped again, on account of the tar in it, Sammy Williams
      and Maurice Levy were there for the same reason, and they just WHISPERED
      'little gentleman,' so low you could hardly hear them&mdash;and Penrod
      began fighting with them right before me, and it was really all the barber
      and I could do to drag him away from them. The barber was very kind about
      it, but Penrod&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you he's a lunatic!&rdquo; Mr. Schofield would have said the same thing
      of a Frenchman infuriated by the epithet &ldquo;camel.&rdquo; The philosophy of insult
      needs expounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;It does seem a kind of frenzy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why on earth should any sane person mind being called&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;It's beyond ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you SH-ing me for?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Schofield explosively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;It's Mr. Kinosling, the new rector of Saint
      Joseph's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH! On the front porch with Margaret; he's going to stay for dinner. I do
      hope&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bachelor, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OUR old minister was speaking of him the other day,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield,
      &ldquo;and he didn't seem so terribly impressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SH! Yes; about thirty, and of course so superior to most of Margaret's
      friends&mdash;boys home from college. She thinks she likes young Robert
      Williams, I know&mdash;but he laughs so much! Of course there isn't any
      comparison. Mr. Kinosling talks so intellectually; it's a good thing for
      Margaret to hear that kind of thing, for a change and, of course, he's
      very spiritual. He seems very much interested in her.&rdquo; She paused to muse.
      &ldquo;I think Margaret likes him; he's so different, too. It's the third time
      he's dropped in this week, and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield grimly, &ldquo;if you and Margaret want him to come
      again, you'd better not let him see Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he's asked to see him; he seems interested in meeting all the family.
      And Penrod nearly always behaves fairly well at table.&rdquo; She paused, and
      then put to her husband a question referring to his interview with Penrod
      upstairs. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you&mdash;do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered gloomily. &ldquo;No, I didn't, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He was
      interrupted by a violent crash of china and metal in the kitchen, a shriek
      from Della, and the outrageous voice of Penrod. The well-informed Della,
      ill-inspired to set up for a wit, had ventured to address the scion of the
      house roguishly as &ldquo;little gentleman,&rdquo; and Penrod, by means of the rapid
      elevation of his right foot, had removed from her supporting hands a laden
      tray. Both parents, started for the kitchen, Mr. Schofield completing his
      interrupted sentence on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rite thus promised was hastily but accurately performed in that
      apartment most distant from the front porch; and, twenty minutes later,
      Penrod descended to dinner. The Rev. Mr. Kinosling had asked for the
      pleasure of meeting him, and it had been decided that the only course
      possible was to cover up the scandal for the present, and to offer an
      undisturbed and smiling family surface to the gaze of the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scorched but not bowed, the smouldering Penrod was led forward for the
      social formulae simultaneously with the somewhat bleak departure of Robert
      Williams, who took his guitar with him, this time, and went in forlorn
      unconsciousness of the powerful forces already set in secret motion to be
      his allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The punishment just undergone had but made the haughty and unyielding soul
      of Penrod more stalwart in revolt; he was unconquered. Every time the one
      intolerable insult had been offered him, his resentment had become the
      hotter, his vengeance the more instant and furious. And, still burning
      with outrage, but upheld by the conviction of right, he was determined to
      continue to the last drop of his blood the defense of his honour, whenever
      it should be assailed, no matter how mighty or august the powers that
      attacked it. In all ways, he was a very sore boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the brief ceremony of presentation, his usually inscrutable
      countenance wore an expression interpreted by his father as one of insane
      obstinacy, while Mrs. Schofield found it an incentive to inward prayer.
      The fine graciousness of Mr. Kinosling, however, was unimpaired by the
      glare of virulent suspicion given him by this little brother: Mr.
      Kinosling mistook it for a natural curiosity concerning one who might
      possibly become, in time, a member of the family. He patted Penrod upon
      the head, which was, for many reasons, in no condition to be patted with
      any pleasure to the patter. Penrod felt himself in the presence of a new
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, my little lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling. &ldquo;I trust we shall
      become fast friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the ear of his little lad, it seemed he said, &ldquo;A trost we shall
      bick-home fawst frainds.&rdquo; Mr. Kinosling's pronunciation was, in fact,
      slightly precious; and, the little lad, simply mistaking it for some
      cryptic form of mockery of himself, assumed a manner and expression which
      argued so ill for the proposed friendship that Mrs. Schofield hastily
      interposed the suggestion of dinner, and the small procession went in to
      the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a delicious day,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling, presently; &ldquo;warm but
      balmy.&rdquo; With a benevolent smile he addressed Penrod, who sat opposite him.
      &ldquo;I suppose, little gentleman, you have been indulging in the usual outdoor
      sports of vacation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laid down his fork and glared, open-mouthed at Mr. Kinosling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have another slice of breast of the chicken?&rdquo; Mr. Schofield
      inquired, loudly and quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lovely day!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret, with equal promptitude and emphasis.
      &ldquo;Lovely, oh, lovely! Lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield, and after a glance
      at Penrod which confirmed her impression that he intended to say
      something, she continued, &ldquo;Yes, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful,
      beautiful, beautiful beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod closed his mouth and sank back in his chair&mdash;and his relatives
      took breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling looked pleased. This responsive family, with its ready
      enthusiasm, made the kind of audience he liked. He passed a delicate white
      hand gracefully over his tall, pale forehead, and smiled indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youth relaxes in summer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Boyhood is the age of relaxation; one
      is playful, light, free, unfettered. One runs and leaps and enjoys one's
      self with one's companions. It is good for the little lads to play with
      their friends; they jostle, push, and wrestle, and simulate little, happy
      struggles with one another in harmless conflict. The young muscles are
      toughening. It is good. Boyish chivalry develops, enlarges, expands. The
      young learn quickly, intuitively, spontaneously. They perceive the
      obligations of noblesse oblige. They begin to comprehend the necessity of
      caste and its requirements. They learn what birth means&mdash;ah,&mdash;that
      is, they learn what it means to be well born. They learn courtesy in their
      games; they learn politeness, consideration for one another in their
      pastimes, amusements, lighter occupations. I make it my pleasure to join
      them often, for I sympathize with them in all their wholesome joys as well
      as in their little bothers and perplexities. I understand them, you see;
      and let me tell you it is no easy matter to understand the little lads and
      lassies.&rdquo; He sent to each listener his beaming glance, and, permitting it
      to come to rest upon Penrod, inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you say to that, little gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield uttered a stentorian cough. &ldquo;More? You'd better have some
      more chicken! More! Do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More chicken!&rdquo; urged Margaret simultaneously. &ldquo;Do please! Please! More!
      Do! More!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful,&rdquo; began Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;Beautiful, beautiful,
      beautiful, beautiful&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not known in what light Mr. Kinosling viewed the expression of
      Penrod's face. Perhaps he mistook it for awe; perhaps he received no
      impression at all of its extraordinary quality. He was a rather
      self-engrossed young man, just then engaged in a double occupation, for he
      not only talked, but supplied from his own consciousness a critical though
      favourable auditor as well, which of course kept him quite busy. Besides,
      it is oftener than is expected the case that extremely peculiar
      expressions upon the countenances of boys are entirely overlooked, and
      suggest nothing to the minds of people staring straight at them. Certainly
      Penrod's expression&mdash;which, to the perception of his family, was
      perfectly horrible&mdash;caused not the faintest perturbation in the
      breast of Mr. Kinosling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling waived the chicken, and continued to talk. &ldquo;Yes, I think I
      may claim to understand boys,&rdquo; he said, smiling thoughtfully. &ldquo;One has
      been a boy one's self. Ah, it is not all playtime! I hope our young
      scholar here does not overwork himself at his Latin, at his classics, as I
      did, so that at the age of eight years I was compelled to wear glasses. He
      must be careful not to strain the little eyes at his scholar's tasks, not
      to let the little shoulders grow round over his scholar's desk. Youth is
      golden; we should keep it golden, bright, glistening. Youth should frolic,
      should be sprightly; it should play its cricket, its tennis, its
      hand-ball. It should run and leap; it should laugh, should sing madrigals
      and glees, carol with the lark, ring out in chanties, folk-songs, ballads,
      roundelays&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He talked on. At any instant Mr. Schofield held himself ready to cough
      vehemently and shout, &ldquo;More chicken,&rdquo; to drown out Penrod in case the
      fatal words again fell from those eloquent lips; and Mrs. Schofield and
      Margaret kept themselves prepared at all times to assist him. So passed a
      threatening meal, which Mrs. Schofield hurried, by every means with
      decency, to its conclusion. She felt that somehow they would all be safer
      out in the dark of the front porch, and led the way thither as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No cigar, I thank you.&rdquo; Mr. Kinosling, establishing himself in a wicker
      chair beside Margaret, waved away her father's proffer. &ldquo;I do not smoke. I
      have never tasted tobacco in any form.&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield was confirmed in
      her opinion that this would be an ideal son-in-law. Mr. Schofield was not
      so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling. &ldquo;No tobacco for me. No cigar, no pipe, no
      cigarette, no cheroot. For me, a book&mdash;a volume of poems, perhaps.
      Verses, rhymes, lines metrical and cadenced&mdash;those are my
      dissipation. Tennyson by preference: 'Maud,' or 'Idylls of the King'&mdash;poetry
      of the sound Victorian days; there is none later. Or Longfellow will rest
      me in a tired hour. Yes; for me, a book, a volume in the hand, held
      lightly between the fingers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling looked pleasantly at his fingers as he spoke, waving his
      hand in a curving gesture which brought it into the light of a window
      faintly illumined from the interior of the house. Then he passed those
      graceful fingers over his hair, and turned toward Penrod, who was perched
      upon the railing in a dark corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evening is touched with a slight coolness,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling.
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may request the little gentleman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B'gr-r-RUFF!&rdquo; coughed Mr. Schofield. &ldquo;You'd better change your mind about
      a cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you. I was about to request the lit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DO try one,&rdquo; Margaret urged. &ldquo;I'm sure papa's are nice ones. Do try&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you. I remarked a slight coolness in the air, and my hat is
      in the hallway. I was about to request&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get it for you,&rdquo; said Penrod suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will be so good,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling. &ldquo;It is a black bowler hat,
      little gentleman, and placed upon a table in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know where it is.&rdquo; Penrod entered the door, and a feeling of relief,
      mutually experienced, carried from one to another of his three relatives
      their interchanged congratulations that he had recovered his sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The day is done, and the darkness,'&rdquo; began Mr. Kinosling&mdash;and
      recited that poem entire. He followed it with &ldquo;The Children's Hour,&rdquo; and
      after a pause, at the close, to allow his listeners time for a little
      reflection upon his rendition, he passed his handagain over his head, and
      called, in the direction of the doorway:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I will take my hat now, little gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Penrod, unexpectedly climbing over the porch railing,
      in the other direction. His mother and father and Margaret had supposed
      him to be standing in the hallway out of deference, and because he thought
      it tactful not to interrupt the recitations. All of them remembered,
      later, that this supposed thoughtfulness on his part struck them as
      unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, little gentleman!&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling, and being somewhat
      chilled, placed the hat firmly upon his head, pulling it down as far as it
      would go. It had a pleasant warmth, which he noticed at once. The next
      instant, he noticed something else, a peculiar sensation of the scalp&mdash;a
      sensation which he was quite unable to define. He lifted his hand to take
      the hat off, and entered upon a strange experience: his hat seemed to have
      decided to remain where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like Tennyson as much as Longfellow, Mr. Kinosling?&rdquo; inquired
      Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;I cannot say,&rdquo; he returned absently. &ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;each
      has his own&mdash;ugh! flavour and savour, each his&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck by a strangeness in his tone, she peered at him curiously through
      the dusk. His outlines were indistinct, but she made out that his arms
      were, uplifted in a singular gesture. He seemed to be wrenching at his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is anything the matter?&rdquo; she asked anxiously. &ldquo;Mr. Kinosling,
      are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at&mdash;ugh!&mdash;all,&rdquo; he replied, in the same odd tone. &ldquo;I&mdash;ah&mdash;I
      believe&mdash;UGH!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his hands from his hat, and rose. His manner was slightly
      agitated. &ldquo;I fear I may have taken a trifling&mdash;ah&mdash;cold. I
      should&mdash;ah&mdash;perhaps be&mdash;ah&mdash;better at home. I will&mdash;ah&mdash;say
      good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the steps, he instinctively lifted his hand to remove his hat, but did
      not do so, and, saying &ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; again in a frigid voice, departed with
      visible stiffness from that house, to return no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Schofield, astounded. &ldquo;What was
      the matter? He just went&mdash;like that!&rdquo; She made a flurried gesture.
      &ldquo;In heaven's name, Margaret, what DID you say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret indignantly. &ldquo;Nothing! He just WENT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he didn't even take off his hat when he said good-night!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, who had crossed to the doorway, caught the ghost of a whisper
      behind her, where stood Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU BET HE DIDN'T!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew not that he was overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frightful suspicion flashed through Margaret's mind&mdash;a suspicion
      that Mr. Kinosling's hat would have to be either boiled off or shaved off.
      With growing horror she recalled Penrod's long absence when he went to
      bring the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;let me see your hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had toiled at those hands herself late that afternoon, nearly scalding
      her own, but at last achieving a lily purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see your hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they were tarred!

      CHAPTER XXVI THE QUIET AFTERNOON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps middle-aged people might discern Nature's real intentions in the
      matter of pain if they would examine a boy's punishments and sorrows, for
      he prolongs neither beyond their actual duration. With a boy, trouble must
      be of Homeric dimensions to last overnight. To him, every next day is
      really a new day. Thus, Penrod woke, next morning, with neither the
      unspared rod, nor Mr. Kinosling in his mind. Tar, itself, so far as his
      consideration of it went, might have been an undiscovered substance. His
      mood was cheerful and mercantile; some process having worked mysteriously
      within him, during the night, to the result that his first waking thought
      was of profits connected with the sale of old iron&mdash;or perhaps a
      ragman had passed the house, just before he woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      By ten o'clock he had formed a partnership with the indeed amiable Sam,
      and the firm of Schofield and Williams plunged headlong into commerce.
      Heavy dealings in rags, paper, old iron and lead gave the firm a balance
      of twenty-two cents on the evening of the third day; but a venture in
      glassware, following, proved disappointing on account of the scepticism of
      all the druggists in that part of town, even after seven laborious hours
      had been spent in cleansing a wheelbarrow-load of old medicine bottles
      with hydrant water and ashes. Likewise, the partners were disheartened by
      their failure to dispose of a crop of &ldquo;greens,&rdquo; although they had uprooted
      specimens of that decorative and unappreciated flower, the dandelion, with
      such persistence and energy that the Schofields' and Williams' lawns
      looked curiously haggard for the rest of that summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fit passed: business languished; became extinct. The dog-days had set
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      One August afternoon was so hot that even boys sought indoor shade. In the
      dimness of the vacant carriage-house of the stable, lounged Masters Penrod
      Schofield, Samuel Williams, Maurice Levy, Georgie Bassett, and Herman.
      They sat still and talked. It is a hot day, in rare truth, when boys
      devote themselves principally to conversation, and this day was that hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their elders should beware such days. Peril hovers near when the
      fierceness of weather forces inaction and boys in groups are quiet. The
      more closely volcanoes, Western rivers, nitroglycerin, and boys are pent,
      the deadlier is their action at the point of outbreak. Thus, parents and
      guardians should look for outrages of the most singular violence and of
      the most peculiar nature during the confining weather of February and
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing which befell upon this broiling afternoon began to brew and stew
      peacefully enough. All was innocence and languor; no one could have
      foretold the eruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were upon their great theme: &ldquo;When I get to be a man!&rdquo; Being human,
      though boys, they considered their present estate too commonplace to be
      dwelt upon. So, when the old men gather, they say: &ldquo;When I was a boy!&rdquo; It
      really is the land of nowadays that we never discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I'm a man,&rdquo; said Sam Williams, &ldquo;I'm goin' to hire me a couple of
      coloured waiters to swing me in a hammock and keep pourin' ice-water on me
      all day out o' those waterin'-cans they sprinkle flowers from. I'll hire
      you for one of 'em, Herman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you ain' goin' to,&rdquo; said Herman promptly. &ldquo;You ain' no flowuh. But
      nev' min' nat, anyway. Ain' nobody goin' haih me whens <i>I</i>'m a man.
      Goin' be my own boss. <i>I</i>'m go' be a rai'road man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean like a superintendent, or sumpthing like that, and sell
      tickets?&rdquo; asked Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sup'in&mdash;nev' min' nat! Sell ticket? NO suh! Go' be a PO'tuh! My
      uncle a po'tuh right now. Solid gole buttons&mdash;oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generals get a lot more buttons than porters,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;Generals&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po'tuhs make the bes' l'vin',&rdquo; Herman interrupted. &ldquo;My uncle spen' mo'
      money 'n any white man n'is town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I rather be a general,&rdquo; said Penrod, &ldquo;or a senator, or sumpthing
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senators live in Warshington,&rdquo; Maurice Levy contributed the information.
      &ldquo;I been there. Warshington ain't so much; Niag'ra Falls is a hundred times
      as good as Warshington. So's 'Tlantic City, I was there, too. I been
      everywhere there is. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; said Sam Williams, raising his voice in order to obtain
      the floor, &ldquo;anyway, I'm goin' to lay in a hammock all day, and have
      ice-water sprinkled on top o' me, and I'm goin' to lay there all night,
      too, and the next day. I'm goin' to lay there a couple o' years, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you don't!&rdquo; exclaimed Maurice. &ldquo;What'd you do in winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you goin' to do when it's winter, out in a hammock with water
      sprinkled on top o' you all day? I bet you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd stay right there,&rdquo; Sam declared, with strong conviction, blinking as
      he looked out through the open doors at the dazzling lawn and trees,
      trembling in the heat. &ldquo;They couldn't sprinkle too much for ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'd make icicles all over you, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it would,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I'd eat 'em up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it'd snow on you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! I'd swaller it as fast as it'd come down. I wish I had a BARREL o'
      snow right now. I wish this whole barn was full of it. I wish they wasn't
      anything in the whole world except just good ole snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod and Herman rose and went out to the hydrant, where they drank long
      and ardently. Sam was still talking about snow when they returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wouldn't just roll in it. I'd stick it all round inside my clo'es,
      and fill my hat. No, I'd freeze a big pile of it all hard, and I'd roll
      her out flat and then I'd carry her down to some ole tailor's and have him
      make me a SUIT out of her, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you keep still about your ole snow?&rdquo; demanded Penrod petulantly.
      &ldquo;Makes me so thirsty I can't keep still, and I've drunk so much now I bet
      I bust. That ole hydrant water's mighty near hot anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to have a big store, when I grow up,&rdquo; volunteered Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candy store?&rdquo; asked Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO, sir! I'll have candy in it, but not to eat, so much. It's goin' to be
      a deportment store: ladies' clothes, gentlemen's clothes, neckties, china
      goods, leather goods, nice lines in woollings and lace goods&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay! I wouldn't give a five-for-a-cent marble for your whole store,&rdquo; said
      Sam. &ldquo;Would you, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for ten of 'em; not for a million of 'em! <i>I</i>'m goin' to have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; clamoured Maurice. &ldquo;You'd be foolish, because they'd be a toy
      deportment in my store where they'd be a hunderd marbles! So, how much
      would you think your five-for-a-cent marble counts for? And when I'm
      keepin' my store I'm goin' to get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; shrieked Sam derisively. &ldquo;MARRIED! Listen!&rdquo; Penrod and Herman
      joined in the howl of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certumly I'll get married,&rdquo; asserted Maurice stoutly. &ldquo;I'll get married
      to Marjorie Jones. She likes me awful good, and I'm her beau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think so?&rdquo; inquired Penrod in a cryptic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she's my beau, too,&rdquo; came the prompt answer. &ldquo;I'm her beau
      because she's my beau; I guess that's plenty reason! I'll get married to
      her as soon as I get my store running nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod looked upon him darkly, but, for the moment, held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married!&rdquo; jeered Sam Williams. &ldquo;Married to Marjorie Jones! You're the
      only boy I ever heard say he was going to get married. I wouldn't get
      married for&mdash;why, I wouldn't for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Unable to
      think of any inducement the mere mention of which would not be
      ridiculously incommensurate, he proceeded: &ldquo;I wouldn't do it! What you
      want to get married for? What do married people do, except just come home
      tired, and worry around and kind of scold? You better not do it, M'rice;
      you'll be mighty sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody gets married,&rdquo; stated Maurice, holding his ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They gotta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bet <i>I</i> don't!&rdquo; Sam returned hotly. &ldquo;They better catch me
      before they tell ME I have to. Anyway, I bet nobody has to get married
      unless they want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do, too,&rdquo; insisted Maurice. &ldquo;They GOTTA!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at what my own papa told me!&rdquo; cried Maurice, heated with argument.
      &ldquo;Didn't he tell me your papa had to marry your mamma, or else he never'd
      got to handle a cent of her money? Certumly, people gotta marry.
      Everybody. You don't know anybody over twenty years old that isn't married&mdash;except
      maybe teachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at policemen!&rdquo; shouted Sam triumphantly. &ldquo;You don't s'pose anybody
      can make policemen get married, I reckon, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, policemen, maybe,&rdquo; Maurice was forced to admit. &ldquo;Policemen and
      teachers don't, but everybody else gotta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be a policeman,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;THEN I guess they won't come
      around tellin' me I have to get married. What you goin' to be, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chief police,&rdquo; said the laconic Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you?&rdquo; Sam inquired of quiet Georgie Bassett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to be,&rdquo; said Georgie, consciously, &ldquo;a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This announcement created a sensation so profound that it was followed by
      silence. Herman was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean preachuh?&rdquo; he asked incredulously. &ldquo;You go' PREACH?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Georgie, looking like Saint Cecilia at the organ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman was impressed. &ldquo;You know all 'at preachuh talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to learn it,&rdquo; said Georgie simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How loud kin you holler?&rdquo; asked Herman doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't holler at all,&rdquo; Penrod interposed with scorn. &ldquo;He hollers like a
      girl. He's the poorest hollerer in town!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman shook his head. Evidently he thought Georgie's chance of being
      ordained very slender. Nevertheless, a final question put to the candidate
      by the coloured expert seemed to admit one ray of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good kin you clim a pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can't climb one at all,&rdquo; Penrod answered for Georgie. &ldquo;Over at Sam's
      turning-pole you ought to see him try to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Preachers don't have to climb poles,&rdquo; Georgie said with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GOOD ones do,&rdquo; declared Herman. &ldquo;Bes' one ev' <i>I</i> hear, he clim up
      an' down same as a circus man. One n'em big 'vivals outen whens we livin'
      on a fahm, preachuh clim big pole right in a middle o' the church, what
      was to hol' roof up. He clim way high up, an' holler: 'Goin' to heavum,
      goin' to heavum, goin' to heavum NOW. Hallelujah, praise my Lawd!' An' he
      slide down little, an' holler: 'Devil's got a hol' o' my coat-tails; devil
      tryin' to drag me down! Sinnuhs, take wawnun! Devil got a hol' o' my
      coat-tails; I'm a-goin' to hell, oh Lawd!' Nex', he clim up little mo',
      an' yell an' holler: 'Done shuck ole devil loose; goin' straight to heavum
      agin! Goin' to heavum, goin' to heavum, my Lawd!' Nex', he slide down some
      mo' an' holler, 'Leggo my coat-tails, ole devil! Goin' to hell agin,
      sinnuhs! Goin' straight to hell, my Lawd!' An' he clim an' he slide, an'
      he slide, an' he clim, an' all time holler: 'Now 'm a-goin' to heavum; now
      'm a-goin' to hell! Goin'to heavum, heavum, heavum, my Lawd!' Las' he
      slide all a-way down, jes' a-squallin' an' a-kickin' an' a-rarin' up an'
      squealin', 'Goin' to hell. Goin' to hell! Ole Satum got my soul! Goin' to
      hell! Goin' to hell! Goin' to hell, hell, hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herman possessed that extraordinary facility for vivid acting which is the
      great native gift of his race, and he enchained his listeners. They sat
      fascinated and spellbound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herman, tell that again!&rdquo; said Penrod, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herman, nothing loath, accepted the encore and repeated the Miltonic
      episode, expanding it somewhat, and dwelling with a fine art upon those
      portions of the narrative which he perceived to be most exciting to his
      audience. Plainly, they thrilled less to Paradise gained than to its
      losing, and the dreadful climax of the descent into the Pit was the
      greatest treat of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was immense and instant. Penrod sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie Bassett couldn't do that to save his life,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;<i>I</i>'m
      goin' to be a preacher! I'D be all right for one, wouldn't I, Herman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; Sam Williams echoed loudly. &ldquo;I guess I can do it if YOU can.
      I'd be better'n Penrod, wouldn't I, Herman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, too!&rdquo; Maurice shouted. &ldquo;I got a stronger voice than anybody here,
      and I'd like to know what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three clamoured together indistinguishably, each asserting his
      qualifications for the ministry according to Herman's theory, which had
      been accepted by these sudden converts without question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to ME!&rdquo; Maurice bellowed, proving his claim to at least the voice
      by drowning the others. &ldquo;Maybe I can't climb a pole so good, but who can
      holler louder'n this? Listen to ME-E-E!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; cried Penrod, irritated. &ldquo;Go to heaven; go to hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oo-o-oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Georgie Bassett, profoundly shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam and Maurice, awed by Penrod's daring, ceased from turmoil, staring
      wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cursed and swore!&rdquo; said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; cried Penrod, hotly. &ldquo;That isn't swearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said, 'Go to a big H'!&rdquo; said Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not! I said, 'Go to heaven,' before I said a big H. That isn't
      swearing, is it, Herman? It's almost what the preacher said, ain't it,
      Herman? It ain't swearing now, any more&mdash;not if you put 'go to
      heaven' with it, is it, Herman? You can say it all you want to, long as
      you say 'go to heaven' first, CAN'T you, Herman? Anybody can say it if the
      preacher says it, can't they, Herman? I guess I know when I ain't
      swearing, don't I, Herman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Herman ruled for the defendant, and Penrod was considered to have
      carried his point. With fine consistency, the conclave established that it
      was proper for the general public to &ldquo;say it,&rdquo; provided &ldquo;go to heaven&rdquo;
       should in all cases precede it. This prefix was pronounced a perfect
      disinfectant, removing all odour of impiety or insult; and, with the
      exception of Georgie Bassett (who maintained that the minister's words
      were &ldquo;going&rdquo; and &ldquo;gone,&rdquo; not &ldquo;go&rdquo;), all the boys proceeded to exercise
      their new privilege so lavishly that they tired of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no diminution of evangelical ardour; again were heard the
      clamours of dispute as to which was the best qualified for the ministry,
      each of the claimants appealing passionately to Herman, who, pleased but
      confused, appeared to be incapable of arriving at a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a pause, Georgie Bassett asserted his prior rights. &ldquo;Who said it
      first, I'd like to know?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I was going to be a minister from
      long back of to-day, I guess. And I guess I said I was going to be a
      minister right to-day before any of you said anything at all. DIDN'T I,
      Herman? YOU heard me, didn't you, Herman? That's the very thing started
      you talking about it, wasn't it, Herman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You' right,&rdquo; said Herman. &ldquo;You the firs' one to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, Sam, and Maurice immediately lost faith in Herman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if you did say it first?&rdquo; Penrod shouted. &ldquo;You couldn't BE a
      minister if you were a hunderd years old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet his mother wouldn't let him be one,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;She never lets him
      do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would, too,&rdquo; retorted Georgie. &ldquo;Ever since I was little, she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's too sissy to be a preacher!&rdquo; cried Maurice. &ldquo;Listen at his squeaky
      voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to be a better minister,&rdquo; shouted Georgie, &ldquo;than all three of
      you put together. I could do it with my left hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three laughed bitingly in chorus. They jeered, derided, scoffed, and
      raised an uproar which would have had its effect upon much stronger nerves
      than Georgie's. For a time he contained his rising choler and chanted
      monotonously, over and over: &ldquo;I COULD! I COULD, TOO! I COULD! I COULD,
      TOO!&rdquo; But their tumult wore upon him, and he decided to avail himself of
      the recent decision whereby a big H was rendered innocuous and unprofane.
      Having used the expression once, he found it comforting, and substituted
      it for: &ldquo;I could! I could, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it relieved him only temporarily. His tormentors were unaffected by it
      and increased their howlings, until at last Georgie lost his head
      altogether. Badgered beyond bearing, his eyes shining with a wild light,
      he broke through the besieging trio, hurling little Maurice from his path
      with a frantic hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you!&rdquo; he cried, in this sudden frenzy. &ldquo;You give me a chance,
      and I'll prove it right NOW!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's talkin' business!&rdquo; shouted Penrod. &ldquo;Everybody keep still a minute.
      Everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took command of the situation at once, displaying a fine capacity for
      organization and system. It needed only a few minutes to set order in the
      place of confusion and to determine, with the full concurrence of all
      parties, the conditions under which Georgie Bassett was to defend his
      claim by undergoing what may be perhaps intelligibly defined as the Herman
      test. Georgie declared he could do it easily. He was in a state of great
      excitement and in no condition to think calmly or, probably, he would not
      have made the attempt at all. Certainly he was overconfident.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII CONCLUSION OF THE QUIET AFTERNOON
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was during the discussion of the details of this enterprise that
      Georgie's mother, a short distance down the street, received a few female
      callers, who came by appointment to drink a glass of iced tea with her,
      and to meet the Rev. Mr. Kinosling. Mr. Kinosling was proving almost
      formidably interesting to the women and girls of his own and other flocks.
      What favour of his fellow clergymen a slight precociousness of manner and
      pronunciation cost him was more than balanced by the visible ecstasies of
      ladies. They blossomed at his touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just entered Mrs. Bassett's front door, when the son of the house,
      followed by an intent and earnest company of four, opened the alley gate
      and came into the yard. The unconscious Mrs. Bassett was about to have her
      first experience of a fatal coincidence. It was her first, because she was
      the mother of a boy so well behaved that he had become a proverb of
      transcendency. Fatal coincidences were plentiful in the Schofield and
      Williams families, and would have been familiar to Mrs. Bassett had
      Georgie been permitted greater intimacy with Penrod and Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling sipped his iced tea and looked about, him approvingly. Seven
      ladies leaned forward, for it was to be seen that he meant to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This cool room is a relief,&rdquo; he said, waving a graceful hand in a neatly
      limited gesture, which everybody's eyes followed, his own included. &ldquo;It is
      a relief and a retreat. The windows open, the blinds closed&mdash;that is
      as it should be. It is a retreat, a fastness, a bastion against the heat's
      assault. For me, a quiet room&mdash;a quiet room and a book, a volume in
      the hand, held lightly between the fingers. A volume of poems, lines
      metrical and cadenced; something by a sound Victorian. We have no later
      poets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swinburne?&rdquo; suggested Miss Beam, an eager spinster. &ldquo;Swinburne, Mr.
      Kinosling? Ah, SWINBURNE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Swinburne,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling chastely. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That concluded all the remarks about Swinburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Beam retired in confusion behind another lady; and somehow there
      became diffused an impression that Miss Beam was erotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not observe your manly little son,&rdquo; Mr. Kinosling addressed his
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's out playing in the yard,&rdquo; Mrs. Bassett returned. &ldquo;I heard his voice
      just now, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everywhere I hear wonderful report of him,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling. &ldquo;I may
      say that I understand boys, and I feel that he is a rare, a fine, a pure,
      a lofty spirit. I say spirit, for spirit is the word I hear spoken of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of enthusiastic approbation affirmed the accuracy of this
      proclamation, and Mrs. Bassett flushed with pleasure. Georgie's spiritual
      perfection was demonstrated by instances of it, related by the visitors;
      his piety was cited, and wonderful things he had said were quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all boys are pure, of fine spirit, of high mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling,
      and continued with true feeling: &ldquo;You have a neighbour, dear Mrs. Bassett,
      whose household I indeed really feel it quite impossible to visit until
      such time when better, firmer, stronger handed, more determined discipline
      shall prevail. I find Mr. and Mrs. Schofield and their daughter charming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three or four ladies said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and spoke a name simultaneously. It was as
      if they had said, &ldquo;Oh, the bubonic plague!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Penrod Schofield!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georgie does not play with him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bassett quickly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      is, he avoids him as much as he can without hurting Penrod's feelings.
      Georgie is very sensitive to giving pain. I suppose a mother should not
      tell these things, and I know people who talk about their own children are
      dreadful bores, but it was only last Thursday night that Georgie looked up
      in my face so sweetly, after he had said his prayers and his little cheeks
      flushed, as he said: 'Mamma, I think it would be right for me to go more
      with Penrod. I think it would make him a better boy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sibilance went about the room. &ldquo;Sweet! How sweet! The sweet little soul!
      Ah, SWEET!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that very afternoon,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Bassett, &ldquo;he had come home in a
      dreadful state. Penrod had thrown tar all over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son has a forgiving spirit!&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling with vehemence. &ldquo;A
      too forgiving spirit, perhaps.&rdquo; He set down his glass. &ldquo;No more, I thank
      you. No more cake, I thank you. Was it not Cardinal Newman who said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by the sounds of an altercation just outside the closed
      blinds of the window nearest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him pick his tree!&rdquo; It was the voice of Samuel Williams. &ldquo;Didn't we
      come over here to give him one of his own trees? Give him a fair show,
      can't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little lads!&rdquo; Mr. Kinosling smiled. &ldquo;They have their games, their
      outdoor sports, their pastimes. The young muscles are toughening. The sun
      will not harm them. They grow; they expand; they learn. They learn fair
      play, honour, courtesy, from one another, as pebbles grow round in the
      brook. They learn more from themselves than from us. They take shape,
      form, outline. Let them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kinosling!&rdquo; Another spinster&mdash;undeterred by what had happened to
      Miss Beam&mdash;leaned fair forward, her face shining and ardent. &ldquo;Mr.
      Kinosling, there's a question I DO wish to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Cosslit,&rdquo; Mr. Kinosling responded, again waving his hand and
      watching it, &ldquo;I am entirely at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WAS Joan of Arc,&rdquo; she asked fervently, &ldquo;inspired by spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled indulgently. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One must give both
      answers. One must give the answer, yes; one must give the answer, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, THANK you!&rdquo; said Miss Cosslit, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's one of my great enthusiasms, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have a question, too,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Lora Rewbush, after a moment's
      hasty concentration. &ldquo;'I've never been able to settle it for myself, but
      NOW&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Mr. Kinosling encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;ah&mdash;is&mdash;oh, yes: Is Sanskrit a more difficult language
      than Spanish, Mr. Kinosling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon the student,&rdquo; replied the oracle smiling. &ldquo;One must not
      look for linguists everywhere. In my own especial case&mdash;if one may
      cite one's self as an example&mdash;I found no great, no insurmountable
      difficulty in mastering, in conquering either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may <i>I</i> ask one?&rdquo; ventured Mrs. Bassett. &ldquo;Do you think it is
      right to wear egrets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are marks of quality, of caste, of social distinction,&rdquo; Mr.
      Kinosling began, &ldquo;which must be permitted, allowed, though perhaps
      regulated. Social distinction, one observes, almost invariably implies
      spiritual distinction as well. Distinction of circumstances is accompanied
      by mental distinction. Distinction is hereditary; it descends from father
      to son, and if there is one thing more true than 'Like father, like son,'
      it is&mdash;&rdquo; he bowed gallantly to Mrs. Bassett&mdash;&ldquo;it is, 'Like
      mother, like son.' What these good ladies have said this afternoon of YOUR&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the fatal instant. There smote upon all ears the voice of
      Georgie, painfully shrill and penetrating&mdash;fraught with protest and
      protracted, strain. His plain words consisted of the newly sanctioned and
      disinfected curse with a big H.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an ejaculation of horror, Mrs. Bassett sprang to the window and threw
      open the blinds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georgie's back was disclosed to the view of the tea-party. He was
      endeavouring to ascend a maple tree about twelve feet from the window.
      Embracing the trunk with arms and legs, he had managed to squirm to a
      point above the heads of Penrod and Herman, who stood close by, watching
      him earnestly&mdash;Penrod being obviously in charge of the performance.
      Across the yard were Sam Williams and Maurice Levy, acting as a jury on
      the question of voice-power, and it was to a complaint of theirs that
      Georgie had just replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Georgie,&rdquo; said Penrod encouragingly. &ldquo;They can, too, hear
      you. Let her go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to heaven!&rdquo; shrieked Georgie, squirming up another inch. &ldquo;Going to
      heaven, heaven, heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother's frenzied attempts to attract his attention failed utterly.
      Georgie was using the full power of his lungs, deafening his own ears to
      all other sounds. Mrs. Bassett called in vain; while the tea-party stood
      petrified in a cluster about the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to heaven!&rdquo; Georgie bellowed. &ldquo;Going to heaven! Going to heaven, my
      Lord! Going to heaven, heaven, heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to climb higher, but began to slip downward, his exertions
      causing damage to his apparel. A button flew into the air, and his
      knickerbockers and his waistband severed relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil's got my coat-tails, sinners! Old devil's got my coat-tails!&rdquo; he
      announced appropriately. Then he began to slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He relaxed his clasp of the tree and slid to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to hell!&rdquo; shrieked Georgie, reaching a high pitch of enthusiasm in
      this great climax. &ldquo;Going to hell! Going to hell! I'm gone to hell, hell,
      hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a loud scream, Mrs. Bassett threw herself out of the window,
      alighting by some miracle upon her feet with ankles unsprained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling, feeling that his presence as spiritual adviser was demanded
      in the yard, followed with greater dignity through the front door. At the
      corner of the house a small departing figure collided with him violently.
      It was Penrod, tactfully withdrawing from what promised to be a family
      scene of unusual painfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kinosling seized him by the shoulders and, giving way to emotion,
      shook him viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You horrible boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Kinosling. &ldquo;You ruffianly creature! Do
      you know what's going to happen to you when you grow up? Do you realize
      what you're going to BE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With flashing eyes, the indignant boy made know his unshaken purpose. He
      shouted the reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minister!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVIII TWELVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      This busy globe which spawns us is as incapable of flattery and as intent
      upon its own affair, whatever that is, as a gyroscope; it keeps steadily
      whirling along its lawful track, and, thus far seeming to hold a right of
      way, spins doggedly on, with no perceptible diminution of speed to mark
      the most gigantic human events&mdash;it did not pause to pant and
      recuperate even when what seemed to Penrod its principal purpose was
      accomplished, and an enormous shadow, vanishing westward over its surface,
      marked the dawn of his twelfth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be twelve is an attainment worth the struggle. A boy, just twelve, is
      like a Frenchman just elected to the Academy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distinction and honour wait upon him. Younger boys show deference to a
      person of twelve: his experience is guaranteed, his judgment, therefore,
      mellow; consequently, his influence is profound. Eleven is not quite
      satisfactory: it is only an approach. Eleven has the disadvantage of six,
      of nineteen, of forty-four, and of sixty-nine. But, like twelve, seven is
      an honourable age, and the ambition to attain it is laudable. People look
      forward to being seven. Similarly, twenty is worthy, and so, arbitrarily,
      is twenty-one; forty-five has great solidity; seventy is most commendable
      and each year thereafter an increasing honour. Thirteen is embarrassed by
      the beginnings of a new colthood; the child becomes a youth. But twelve is
      the very top of boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dressing, that morning, Penrod felt that the world was changed from the
      world of yesterday. For one thing, he seemed to own more of it; this day
      was HIS day. And it was a day worth owning; the midsummer sunshine,
      pouring gold through his window, came from a cool sky, and a breeze moved
      pleasantly in his hair as he leaned from the sill to watch the tribe of
      clattering blackbirds take wing, following their leader from the trees in
      the yard to the day's work in the open country. The blackbirds were his,
      as the sunshine and the breeze were his, for they all belonged to the day
      which was his birthday and therefore most surely his. Pride suffused him:
      he was twelve!
    </p>
    <p>
      His father and his mother and Margaret seemed to understand the difference
      between to-day and yesterday. They were at the table when he descended,
      and they gave him a greeting which of itself marked the milestone.
      Habitually, his entrance into a room where his elders sat brought a cloud
      of apprehension: they were prone to look up in pathetic expectancy, as if
      their thought was, &ldquo;What new awfulness is he going to start NOW?&rdquo; But this
      morning they laughed; his mother rose and kissed him twelve times, so did
      Margaret; and his father shouted, &ldquo;Well, well! How's the MAN?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his mother gave him a Bible and &ldquo;The Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo;; Margaret
      gave him a pair of silver-mounted hair brushes; and his father gave him a
      &ldquo;Pocket Atlas&rdquo; and a small compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Penrod,&rdquo; said his mother, after breakfast, &ldquo;I'm going to take
      you out in the country to pay your birthday respects to Aunt Sarah Crim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sarah Crim, Penrod's great-aunt, was his oldest living relative. She
      was ninety, and when Mrs. Schofield and Penrod alighted from a carriage at
      her gate they found her digging with a spade in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you brought him,&rdquo; she said, desisting from labour. &ldquo;Jinny's
      baking a cake I'm going to send for his birthday party. Bring him in the
      house. I've got something for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way to her &ldquo;sitting-room,&rdquo; which had a pleasant smell, unlike
      any other smell, and, opening the drawer of a shining old what-not, took
      therefrom a boy's &ldquo;sling-shot,&rdquo; made of a forked stick, two strips of
      rubber and a bit of leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn't for you,&rdquo; she said, placing it in Penrod's eager hand. &ldquo;No. It
      would break all to pieces the first time you tried to shoot it, because it
      is thirty-five years old. I want to send it back to your father. I think
      it's time. You give it to him from me, and tell him I say I believe I can
      trust him with it now. I took it away from him thirty-five years ago, one
      day after he'd killed my best hen with it, accidentally, and broken a
      glass pitcher on the back porch with it&mdash;accidentally. He doesn't
      look like a person who's ever done things of that sort, and I suppose he's
      forgotten it so well that he believes he never DID, but if you give it to
      him from me I think he'll remember. You look like him, Penrod. He was
      anything but a handsome boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this final bit of reminiscence&mdash;probably designed to be
      repeated to Mr. Schofield&mdash;she disappeared in the direction of the
      kitchen, and returned with a pitcher of lemonade and a blue china dish
      sweetly freighted with flat ginger cookies of a composition that was her
      own secret. Then, having set this collation before her guests, she
      presented Penrod with a superb, intricate, and very modern machine of
      destructive capacities almost limitless. She called it a pocket-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll do something horrible with it,&rdquo; she said, composedly. &ldquo;I
      hear you do that with everything, anyhow, so you might as well do it with
      this, and have more fun out of it. They tell me you're the Worst Boy in
      Town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sarah!&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield lifted a protesting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on his birthday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the time to say it. Penrod, aren't you the Worst Boy in Town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod, gazing fondly upon his knife and eating cookies rapidly, answered
      as a matter of course, and absently, &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; said Mrs. Crim. &ldquo;Once you accept a thing about yourself as
      established and settled, it's all right. Nobody minds. Boys are just
      people, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield cried, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are,&rdquo; returned Aunt Sarah. &ldquo;Only they're not quite so awful,
      because they haven't learned to cover themselves all over with little
      pretences. When Penrod grows up he'll be just the same as he is now,
      except that whenever he does what he wants to do he'll tell himself and
      other people a little story about it to make his reason for doing it seem
      nice and pretty and noble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't!&rdquo; said Penrod suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one cookie left,&rdquo; observed Aunt Sarah. &ldquo;Are you going to eat it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her great-nephew, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I guess I better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the old lady. &ldquo;Why do you guess you'd 'better'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Penrod, with a full mouth, &ldquo;it might get all dried up if
      nobody took it, and get thrown out and wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're beginning finely,&rdquo; Mrs. Crim remarked. &ldquo;A year ago you'd have
      taken the cookie without the same sense of thrift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I see that you're twelve years old, that's all. There are more
      cookies, Penrod.&rdquo; She went away, returning with a fresh supply and the
      observation, &ldquo;Of course, you'll be sick before the day's over; you might
      as well get a good start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Schofield looked thoughtful. &ldquo;Aunt Sarah,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;don't you
      really think we improve as we get older?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning,&rdquo; said the old lady, &ldquo;that Penrod hasn't much chance to escape
      the penitentiary if he doesn't? Well, we do learn to restrain ourselves in
      some things; and there are people who really want someone else to take the
      last cookie, though they aren't very common. But it's all right, the world
      seems to be getting on.&rdquo; She gazed whimsically upon her great-nephew and
      added, &ldquo;Of course, when you watch a boy and think about him, it doesn't
      seem to be getting on very fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod moved uneasily in his chair; he was conscious that he was her topic
      but unable to make out whether or not her observations were complimentary;
      he inclined to think they were not. Mrs. Crim settled the question for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Penrod is regarded as the neighbourhood curse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Schofield. &ldquo;He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say the neighbours are right,&rdquo; continued the old lady placidly.
      &ldquo;He's had to repeat the history of the race and go through all the stages
      from the primordial to barbarism. You don't expect boys to be civilized,
      do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well expect eggs to crow. No; you've got to take boys as
      they are, and learn to know them as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, Aunt Sarah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield, &ldquo;I KNOW Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Sarah laughed heartily. &ldquo;Do you think his father knows him, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, men are different,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield returned, apologetically.
      &ldquo;But a mother knows&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod,&rdquo; said Aunt Sarah, solemnly, &ldquo;does your father understand you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as much as he'd understand Sitting Bull!&rdquo; she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll tell you what your mother thinks you are, Penrod. Her real
      belief is that you're a novice in a convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Sarah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she thinks that, because whenever you don't behave like a novice
      she's disappointed in you. And your father really believes that you're a
      decorous, well-trained young business man, and whenever you don't live up
      to that standard you get on his nerves and he thinks you need a walloping.
      I'm sure a day very seldom passes without their both saying they don't
      know what on earth to do with you. Does whipping do you any good, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on and finish the lemonade; there's about glassful left. Oh, take it,
      take it; and don't say why! Of COURSE you're a little pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod laughed gratefully, his eyes fixed upon her over the rim of his
      uptilted glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill yourself up uncomfortably,&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;You're twelve years
      old, and you ought to be happy&mdash;if you aren't anything else. It's
      taken over nineteen hundred years of Christianity and some hundreds of
      thousands of years of other things to produce you, and there you sit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be your turn to struggle and muss things up, for the betterment of
      posterity, soon enough,&rdquo; said Aunt Sarah Crim. &ldquo;Drink your lemonade!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXIX FANCHON
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Sarah's a funny old lady,&rdquo; Penrod observed, on the way back to the
      town. &ldquo;What's she want me to give papa this old sling for? Last thing she
      said was to be sure not to forget to give it to him. HE don't want it; and
      she said, herself, it ain't any good. She's older than you or papa, isn't
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About fifty years older,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Schofield, turning upon him a
      stare of perplexity. &ldquo;Don't cut into the leather with your new knife,
      dear; the livery man might ask us to pay if&mdash;&mdash;No. I wouldn't
      scrape the paint off, either&mdash;nor whittle your shoe with it. COULDN'T
      you put it up until we get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We goin' straight home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We're going to stop at Mrs. Gelbraith's and ask a strange little girl
      to come to your party, this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Fanchon. She's Mrs. Gelbraith's little niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes her so queer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say she's queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I mean that she is a stranger. She lives in New York and has come to
      visit here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's she live in New York for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because her parents live there. You must be very nice to her, Penrod; she
      has been very carefully brought up. Besides, she doesn't know the children
      here, and you must help to keep her from feeling lonely at your party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached Mrs. Gelbraith's, Penrod sat patiently humped upon a
      gilt chair during the lengthy exchange of greetings between his mother.
      and Mrs. Gelbraith. That is one of the things a boy must learn to bear:
      when his mother meets a compeer there is always a long and dreary wait for
      him, while the two appear to be using strange symbols of speech, talking
      for the greater part, it seems to him, simultaneously, and employing a
      wholly incomprehensible system of emphasis at other times not in vogue.
      Penrod twisted his legs, his cap and his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is!&rdquo; Mrs. Gelbraith cried, unexpectedly, and a dark-haired,
      demure person entered the room wearing a look of gracious social
      expectancy. In years she was eleven, in manner about sixty-five, and
      evidently had lived much at court. She performed a curtsey in
      acknowledgment of Mrs. Schofield's greeting, and bestowed her hand upon
      Penrod, who had entertained no hope of such an honour, showed his surprise
      that it should come to him, and was plainly unable to decide what to do
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanchon, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gelbraith, &ldquo;take Penrod out in the yard for a
      while, and play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go the little girl's hand, Penrod,&rdquo; Mrs. Schofield laughed, as the
      children turned toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod hastily dropped the small hand, and exclaiming, with simple
      honesty, &ldquo;Why, <i>I</i> don't want it!&rdquo; followed Fanchon out into the
      sunshiny yard, where they came to a halt and surveyed each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod stared awkwardly at Fanchon, no other occupation suggesting itself
      to him, while Fanchon, with the utmost coolness, made a very thorough
      visual examination of Penrod, favouring him with an estimating scrutiny
      which lasted until he literally wiggled. Finally, she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you buy your ties?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you buy your neckties? Papa gets his at Skoone's. You ought to
      get yours there. I'm sure the one you're wearing isn't from Skoone's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skoone's?&rdquo; Penrod repeated. &ldquo;Skoone's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Fifth Avenue,&rdquo; said Fanchon. &ldquo;It's a very smart shop, the men say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men?&rdquo; echoed Penrod, in a hazy whisper. &ldquo;Men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do your people go in summer?&rdquo; inquired the lady. &ldquo;WE go to Long
      Shore, but so many middle-class people have begun coming there, mamma
      thinks of leaving. The middle classes are simply awful, don't you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're so boorjaw. You speak French, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ran over to Paris last year. It's lovely, don't you think? Don't you
      LOVE the Rue de la Paix?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod wandered in a labyrinth. This girl seemed to be talking, but her
      words were dumfounding, and of course there was no way for him to know
      that he was really listening to her mother. It was his first meeting with
      one of those grown-up little girls, wonderful product of the winter
      apartment and summer hotel; and Fanchon, an only child, was a star of the
      brand. He began to feel resentful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I'll find everything here fearfully Western.
      Some nice people called yesterday, though. Do you know the Magsworth
      Bittses? Auntie says they're charming. Will Roddy be at your party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he will,&rdquo; returned Penrod, finding this intelligible. &ldquo;The mutt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Fanchon exclaimed airily. &ldquo;Aren't you great pals with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's 'pals'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! Don't you know what it means to say you're 'great pals'
      with any one? You ARE an odd child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bugs!&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bit of ruffianism had a curious effect. Fanchon looked upon him with
      sudden favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you, Penrod!&rdquo; she said, in an odd way, and, whatever else there
      may have been in her manner, there certainly was no shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bugs!&rdquo; This repetition may have lacked gallantry, but it was uttered
      in no very decided tone. Penrod was shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; She stepped closer to him, smiling. &ldquo;Your hair is ever so
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sailors' parrots swear like mariners, they say; and gay mothers ought to
      realize that all children are imitative, for, as the precocious Fanchon
      leaned toward Penrod, the manner in which she looked into his eyes might
      have made a thoughtful observer wonder where she had learned her pretty
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was even more confused than he had been by her previous mysteries:
      but his confusion was of a distinctly pleasant and alluring nature: he
      wanted more of it. Looking intentionally into another person's eyes is an
      act unknown to childhood; and Penrod's discovery that it could be done was
      sensational. He had never thought of looking into the eyes of Marjorie
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite all anguish, contumely, tar, and Maurice Levy, he still secretly
      thought of Marjorie, with pathetic constancy, as his &ldquo;beau&rdquo;&mdash;though
      that is not how he would have spelled it. Marjorie was beautiful; her
      curls were long and the colour of amber; her nose was straight and her
      freckles were honest; she was much prettier than this accomplished
      visitor. But beauty is not all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; breathed Fanchon, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to him a fairy creature from some rosier world than this. So
      humble is the human heart, it glorifies and makes glamorous almost any
      poor thing that says to it: &ldquo;I like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod was enslaved. He swallowed, coughed, scratched the back of his
      neck, and said, disjointedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I don't care if you want to. I just as soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll dance together,&rdquo; said Fanchon, &ldquo;at your party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. I just as soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want to, Penrod?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm willing to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Say you WANT to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He used his toe as a gimlet, boring into the ground, his wide open eyes
      staring with intense vacancy at a button on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother appeared upon the porch in departure, calling farewells over
      her shoulder to Mrs. Gelbraith, who stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it!&rdquo; whispered Fanchon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I just as SOON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed satisfied.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX THE BIRTHDAY PARTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A dancing floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard, when Mrs.
      Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode; and a white and scarlet
      striped canopy was in process of erection overhead, to shelter the dancers
      from the sun. Workmen were busy everywhere under the direction of
      Margaret, and the smitten heart of Penrod began to beat rapidly. All this
      was for him; he was Twelve!
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured not. For the
      first time in his life he knew the wish to be sand-papered, waxed, and
      polished to the highest possible degree. And when the operation was over,
      he stood before the mirror in new bloom, feeling encouraged to hope that
      his resemblance to his father was not so strong as Aunt Sarah seemed to
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell, he found; and, as he
      came down the stairs, he had great content in the twinkling of his new
      dancing slippers. He stepped twice on each step, the better to enjoy their
      effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled the odour of the gloves. In
      spite of everything, Penrod had his social capacities. Already it is to be
      perceived that there were in him the makings of a cotillon leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments, squeak of fiddle,
      croon of 'cello, a falling triangle ringing and tinkling to the floor; and
      he turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chosen guests began to arrive, while Penrod, suffering from stage-fright
      and perspiration, stood beside his mother, in the &ldquo;drawing-room,&rdquo; to
      receive them. He greeted unfamiliar acquaintances and intimate
      fellow-criminals with the same frigidity, murmuring: &ldquo;'M glad to see y',&rdquo;
       to all alike, largely increasing the embarrassment which always prevails
      at the beginning of children's festivities. His unnatural pomp and
      circumstance had so thoroughly upset him, in truth, that Marjorie Jones
      received a distinct shock, now to be related. Doctor Thrope, the kind old
      clergyman who had baptized Penrod, came in for a moment to congratulate
      the boy, and had just moved away when it was Marjorie's turn, in the line
      of children, to speak to Penrod. She gave him what she considered a
      forgiving look, and, because of the occasion, addressed him in a perfectly
      courteous manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you many happy returns of the day, Penrod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir!&rdquo; he returned, following Dr. Thrope with a glassy stare in
      which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie. Then he greeted
      Maurice Levy, who was next to Marjorie: &ldquo;'M glad to see y'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dumfounded, Marjorie turned aside, and stood near, observing Penrod with
      gravity. It was the first great surprise of her life. Customarily, she had
      seemed to place his character somewhere between that of the professional
      rioter and that of the orang-outang; nevertheless, her manner at times
      just hinted a consciousness that this Caliban was her property. Wherefore,
      she stared at him incredulously as his head bobbed up and down, in the
      dancing-school bow, greeting his guests. Then she heard an adult voice,
      near her, exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an exquisite child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mariorie galanced up&mdash;a little consciously, though she was used to it&mdash;naturally
      curious to ascertain who was speaking of her. It was Sam Williams' mother
      addressing Mrs. Bassett, both being present to help Mrs. Schofield make
      the festivities festive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exquisite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie: they were not looking at
      her. They were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never seen;
      a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest aspect.
      Her downcast eyes, becoming in one thus entering a crowded room, were all
      that produced the effect of modesty, counteracting something about her
      which might have seemed too assured. She was very slender, very dainty,
      and her apparel was disheartening to the other girls; it was of a knowing
      picturesqueness wholly unfamiliar to them. There was a delicate trace of
      powder upon the lobe of Fanchon's left ear, and the outlines of her
      eyelids, if very closely scrutinized, would have revealed successful
      experimentation with a burnt match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie's lovely eyes dilated: she learned the meaning of hatred at first
      sight. Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion, all at once she
      seemed, to herself, awkward. Poor Marjorie underwent that experience which
      hearty, healthy, little girls and big girls undergo at one time or another&mdash;from
      heels to head she felt herself, somehow, too THICK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penrod blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie saw the blush. Her lovely eyes opened even wider, and in them
      there began to grow a light. It was the light of indignation;&mdash;at
      least, people whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, approached Fanchon, when she had made
      her courtesy to Mrs. Schofield. Fanchon whispered in Roderick's ear also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your hair is pretty, Roddy! Don't forget what you said yesterday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roderick likewise blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice Levy, captivated by the newcomer's appearance, pressed close to
      Roderick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us an intaduction, Roddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Roddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite, Fanchon took
      matters into her own hands, and was presently favourably impressed with
      Maurice, receiving the information that his tie had been brought to him by
      his papa from Skoone's, whereupon she privately informed him that she
      liked wavy hair, and arranged to dance with him. Fanchon also thought
      sandy hair attractive, Sam Williams discovered, a few minutes later, and
      so catholic was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before
      the musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march, and Mrs.
      Schofield brought Penrod to escort the lady from out-of-town to the
      dancing pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Headed by this pair, the children sought partners and paraded solemnly out
      of the front door and round a corner of the house. There they found the
      gay marquee; the small orchestra seated on the lawn at one side of it, and
      a punch bowl of lemonade inviting attention, under a tree. Decorously the
      small couples stepped upon the platform, one after another, and began to
      dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not much like a children's party in our day,&rdquo; Mrs. Williams said to
      Penrod's mother. &ldquo;We'd have been playing 'Quaker-meeting,' 'Clap-in,
      Clap-out,' or 'Going to Jerusalem,' I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or 'Post-office' and 'Drop-the-handkerchief,'&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield.
      &ldquo;Things change so quickly. Imagine asking little Fanchon Gelbraith to play
      'London Bridge'! Penrod seems to be having a difficult time with her, poor
      boy; he wasn't a shining light in the dancing class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Penrod's difficulty was not precisely of the kind his mother
      supposed. Fanchon was showing him a new step, which she taught her next
      partner in turn, continuing instructions during the dancing. The children
      crowded the floor, and in the kaleidoscopic jumble of bobbing heads and
      intermingling figures her extremely different style of motion was
      unobserved by the older people, who looked on, nodding time benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys. Many of the former eagerly
      sought her acquaintance and thronged about her between the dances, when,
      accepting the deference due a cosmopolitan and an oracle of the mode, she
      gave demonstrations of the new step to succeeding groups, professing
      astonishment to find it unknown: it had been &ldquo;all the go,&rdquo; she explained,
      at the Long Shore Casino for fully two seasons. She pronounced &ldquo;slow&rdquo; a
      &ldquo;Fancy Dance&rdquo; executed during an intermission by Baby Rennsdale and
      Georgie Bassett, giving it as her opinion that Miss Rennsdale and Mr.
      Bassett were &ldquo;dead ones&rdquo;; and she expressed surprise that the punch bowl
      contained lemonade and not champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dancing continued, the new step gaining instantly in popularity, fresh
      couples adventuring with every number. The word &ldquo;step&rdquo; is somewhat
      misleading, nothing done with the feet being vital to the evolutions
      introduced by Fanchon. Fanchon's dance came from the Orient by a
      roundabout way; pausing in Spain, taking on a Gallic frankness in
      gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris, combining with a relative from the
      South Seas encountered in San Francisco, flavouring itself with a carefree
      negroid abandon in New Orleans, and, accumulating, too, something
      inexpressible from Mexico and South America, it kept, throughout its
      travels, to the underworld, or to circles where nature is extremely frank
      and rank, until at last it reached the dives of New York, when it
      immediately broke out in what is called civilized society. Thereafter it
      spread, in variously modified forms&mdash;some of them disinfected&mdash;to
      watering-places, and thence, carried by hundreds of older male and female
      Fanchons, over the country, being eagerly adopted everywhere and made
      wholly pure and respectable by the supreme moral axiom that anything is
      all right if enough people do it. Everybody was doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not quite everybody. It was perhaps some test of this dance that earth
      could furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earth, assisted by Fanchon, was furnishing this sight at Penrod's party.
      By the time ice-cream and cake arrived, about half the guests had either
      been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon or were learning by
      imitation, and the education of the other half was resumed with the
      dancing, when the attendant ladies, unconscious of what was happening,
      withdrew into the house for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That orchestra's a dead one,&rdquo; Fanchon remarked to Penrod. &ldquo;We ought to
      liven them up a little!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She approached the musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know,&rdquo; she asked the leader, &ldquo;the Slingo Sligo Slide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The leader giggled, nodded, rapped with his bow upon his violin; and
      Penrod, following Fanchon back upon the dancing floor, blindly brushed
      with his elbow a solitary little figure standing aloof on the lawn at the
      edge of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Marjorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon, she had
      scornfully refused, from the first, to dance the new &ldquo;step,&rdquo; and, because
      of its bonfire popularity, found herself neglected in a society where she
      had reigned as beauty and belle. Faithless Penrod, dazed by the sweeping
      Fanchon, had utterly forgotten the amber curls; he had not once asked
      Marjorie to dance. All afternoon the light of indignation had been growing
      brighter in her eyes, though Maurice Levy's defection to the lady from New
      York had not fanned this flame. From the moment Fanchon had whispered
      familiarly in Penrod's ear, and Penrod had blushed, Marjorie had been
      occupied exclusively with resentment against that guilty pair. It seemed
      to her that Penrod had no right to allow a strange girl to whisper in his
      ear; that his blushing, when the strange girl did it, was atrocious; and
      that the strange girl, herself, ought to be arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten by the merrymakers, Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn,
      clenching her small fists, watching the new dance at its high tide, and
      hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her tremble. And, perhaps
      because jealousy is a great awakener of the virtues, she had a perception
      of something in it worse than lack of dignity&mdash;something vaguely but
      outrageously reprehensible. Finally, when Penrod brushed by her, touched
      her with his elbow, and, did not even see her, Marjorie's state of mind
      (not unmingled with emotion!) became dangerous. In fact, a trained nurse,
      chancing to observe her at this juncture, would probably have advised that
      she be taken home and put to bed. Marjorie was on the verge of hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required by the
      dance; the &ldquo;Slingo Sligo Slide&rdquo; burst from the orchestra like the lunatic
      shriek of a gin-maddened nigger; and all the little couples began to bob
      and dip and sway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie made a scene. She sprang upon the platform and stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penrod Schofield!&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;You BEHAVE yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear. By his ear she swung him away
      from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You march straight out of here!&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod marched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stunned; obeyed automatically, without question, and had very
      little realization of what was happening to him. Altogether, and without
      reason, he was in precisely the condition of an elderly spouse detected in
      flagrant misbehaviour. Marjorie, similarly, was in precisely the condition
      of the party who detects such misbehaviour. It may be added that she had
      acted with a promptness, a decision and a disregard of social consequences
      all to be commended to the attention of ladies in like predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo; she raged, when they reached the
      lawn. &ldquo;Aren't you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; he inquired, helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what'd <i>I</i> do, Marjorie? <i>I</i> haven't done anything to you,&rdquo;
       he pleaded. &ldquo;I haven't even seen you, all aftern&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be quiet!&rdquo; she cried, tears filling her eyes. &ldquo;Keep still! You ugly
      boy! Shut up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slapped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He should have understood from this how much she cared for him. But he
      rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never speak to you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, too!&rdquo; she sobbed, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to leave her, but paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, his sister Margaret, and their grownup friends had finished
      their tea and were approaching from the house. Other parents and guardians
      were with them, coming for their children; and there were carriages and
      automobiles waiting in the street. But the &ldquo;Slingo Slide&rdquo; went on,
      regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group of grown-up people hesitated and came to a halt, gazing at the
      pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Williams, blushing deeply. &ldquo;What is it?
      What IS it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT IS IT?&rdquo; Mrs. Gelbraith echoed in a frightened whisper. &ldquo;WHAT&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're Tangoing!&rdquo; cried Margaret Schofield. &ldquo;Or Bunny Hugging or Grizzly
      Bearing, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're only Turkey Trotting,&rdquo; said Robert Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      With fearful outcries the mothers, aunts, and sisters rushed upon the
      pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was dreadful,&rdquo; said Mrs. Schofield, an hour later, rendering
      her lord an account of the day, &ldquo;but it was every bit the fault of that
      one extraordinary child. And of all the quiet, demur little things&mdash;that
      is, I mean, when she first came. We all spoke of how exquisite she seemed&mdash;so
      well trained, so finished! Eleven years old! I never saw anything like her
      in my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's the New Child,&rdquo; her husband grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think of her saying there ought to have been champagne in the
      lemonade!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably she'd forgotten to bring her pocket flask,&rdquo; he suggested
      musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't you proud of Penrod?&rdquo; cried Penrod's mother. &ldquo;It was just as I
      told you: he was standing clear outside the pavilion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought to see the day! And Penrod was the only boy not doing it,
      the only one to refuse? ALL the others were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one!&rdquo; she returned triumphantly. &ldquo;Even Georgie Bassett!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield, patting her on the shoulder. &ldquo;I guess we can
      hold up our heads at last.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI OVER THE FENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Penrod was out in the yard, staring at the empty marquee. The sun was on
      the horizon line, so far behind the back fence, and a western window of
      the house blazed in gold unbearable to the eye: his day was nearly over.
      He sighed, and took from the inside pocket of his new jacket the
      &ldquo;sling-shot&rdquo; aunt Sarah Crim had given him that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snapped the rubbers absently. They held fast; and his next impulse was
      entirely irresistible. He found a shapely stone, fitted it to the leather,
      and drew back the ancient catapult for a shot. A sparrow hopped upon a
      branch between him and the house, and he aimed at the sparrow, but the
      reflection from the dazzling window struck in his eyes as he loosed the
      leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      He missed the sparrow, but not the window. There was a loud crash, and to
      his horror he caught a glimpse of his father, stricken in mid-shaving,
      ducking a shower of broken glass, glittering razor flourishing wildly.
      Words crashed with the glass, stentorian words, fragmentary but collossal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penrod stood petrified, a broken sling in his hand. He could hear his
      parent's booming descent of the back stairs, instant and furious; and
      then, red-hot above white lather, Mr. Schofield burst out of the kitchen
      door and hurtled forth upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded, shaking Penrod by the shoulder. &ldquo;Ten
      minutes ago, for the very first time in our lives, your mother and I were
      saying we were proud of you, and here you go and throw a rock at me
      through the window when I'm shaving for dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't!&rdquo; Penrod quavered. &ldquo;I was shooting at a sparrow, and the sun got
      in his eyes, and the sling broke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where'd you get that devilish thing? Don't you know I've forbidden you a
      thousand times&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't mine,&rdquo; said Penrod. &ldquo;It's yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the boy meekly. &ldquo;Aunt Sarah Crim gave it to me this
      morning and told me to give it back to you. She said she took it away from
      you thirty-five years ago. You killed her hen, she said. She told me some
      more to tell you, but I've forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mr. Schofield.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the broken sling in his hand, looked at it long and thoughtfully&mdash;and
      he looked longer, and quite as thoughtfully, at Penrod. Then he turned
      away, and walked toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, papa,&rdquo; said Penrod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Schofield coughed, and, as he reached the door, called back, but
      without turning his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, little boy. A broken window isn't much harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone in, Penrod wandered down the yard to the back fence,
      climbed upon it, and sat in reverie there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight figure appeared, likewise upon a fence, beyond two neighbouring
      yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay, Penrod!&rdquo; called comrade Sam Williams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; returned Penrod, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught Billy Blue Hill!&rdquo; shouted Sam, describing retribution in a
      manner perfectly clear to his friend. &ldquo;You were mighty lucky to get out of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't of, if it hadn't been for Marjorie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't I know that?&rdquo; Penrod shouted, with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long!&rdquo; called Sam, dropping from his fence; and the friendly
      voice came then, more faintly, &ldquo;Many happy returns of the day, Penrod!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrod's feet, and,
      looking down, he saw that Duke, his wistful, old, scraggly dog sat in the
      grass, gazing seekingly up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like a blessing
      upon the boy sitting on the fence. Years afterward, a quiet sunset would
      recall to him sometimes the gentle evening of his twelfth birthday, and
      bring him the picture of his boy self, sitting in rosy light upon the
      fence, gazing pensively down upon his wistful, scraggly, little old dog,
      Duke. But something else, surpassing, he would remember of that hour, for,
      in the side street, close by, a pink skirt flickered from behind a shade
      tree to the shelter of the fence, there was a gleam of amber curls, and
      Penrod started, as something like a tiny white wing fluttered by his head,
      and there came to his ears the sound of a light laugh and of light
      footsteps departing, the laughter tremulous, the footsteps fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the grass, between Duke's forepaws, there lay a white note, folded in
      the shape of a cocked hat, and the sun sent forth a final amazing glory as
      Penrod opened it and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your my bow.&rdquo;

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
